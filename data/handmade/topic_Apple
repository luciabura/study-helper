Apple’s first logo, designed by Jobs and Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under
an apple tree. Almost immediately, though, this was replaced by Rob Janoff’s “rainbow
Apple”, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken
out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the
“bitten” logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. While Jobs liked the logo, he
insisted it be in color to humanize the company. The Apple logo was designed with a
bite so that it would be recognized as an apple rather than a cherry. The colored stripes
were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the monitor
could reproduce images in color. In 1998, with the roll-out of the new iMac, Apple
discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly
identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation.
