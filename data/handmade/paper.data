Keywords, consisting of one single word or several words, summarize topics and
ideas of an article. Keywords can benefit many NLP applications, such as text
categorization, document clustering, search engine, etc. In an era when information
on Internet grows explosively, it is intractable to scan every document
thoroughly. Keywords enable us to find documents we need from the ocean of
information.
In order to capture the topics of an article accurately and sufficiently, keywords
usually need to be assigned by experts with adequate domain knowledge. However,
with innumerous documents emerging everyday, it would be too costly to
assign keywords to documents by human efforts. Therefore, automatic keyword
extraction is drawing interests of many researchers and a number of techniques
are applied to this task successfully.
The targets of keyword extraction include news articles, web pages, scientific
articles, etc. Study of keyword extraction for scientific articles is getting more
attention recently, since keywords are essential for retrieving scientific articles
and grasping the trend of academic development. Though keywords are usually
required for scientific articles and academic dissertations, many authors have
trouble selecting proper keywords. And different authors will give keywords following
different criteria.
For keyword extraction for scientific articles, a shared task was held at the
Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2010 (SemEval-2010 Task 5) [1]. It was geared
towards scientific articles in English. However, research on keyword extraction
towards scientific articles in Chinese is relatively rare. We extract keywords from
Chinese scientific articles adopting the framework of selecting keyword candidates
by Document Frequency Accessor Variety(DF-AV) and running TextRank
algorithm on a phrase network. We show how to improve the result of unsupervised
keyword extraction for a certain domain with domain knowledge of known
keywords.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related
work. Section 3 describes the general framework for keyword extraction. Section
4 shows why known keywords can be used as domain knowledge and how to
improve the result of keyword extraction with domain knowledge. Section 5
represents our experiment results and Section 6 concludes our work.
