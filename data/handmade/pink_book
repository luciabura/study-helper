For many years, computer displays resembled paper documents. This does not mean that
they were simplistic or unreasonably constrained. On the contrary, most aspects of modern
industrial society have been successfully achieved using the representational conventions of
paper, so those conventions seem to be powerful ones. Information on paper can be
structured using tabulated columns, alignment, indentation and emphasis, borders and
shading. All of those were incorporated into computer text displays. Interaction
conventions, however, were restricted to operations of the typewriter rather than the pencil.
Each character typed would appear at a specific location. Locations could be constrained,
like filling boxes on a paper form. And shortcut command keys could be defined using
onscreen labels or paper overlays. It is not text itself, but keyboard interaction with text that
is limited and frustrating compared to what we can do with paper (Sellen and Harper 2002).
But despite the constraints on keyboard interaction, most information on computer screens
is still represented as text. Conventions of typography and graphic design help us to
interpret that text as if it were on a page, and human readers benefit from many centuries of
refinement in text document design. Text itself, including many writing systems as well as
specialised notations such as algebra, is a visual representation that has its own research
and educational literature. Documents that contain a mix of bordered or coloured regions
containing pictures, text and diagrammatic elements can be interpreted according to the
conventions of magazine design, poster advertising, form design, textbooks and
encyclopaedias. Designers of screen representations should take care to properly apply the
specialist knowledge of those graphic and typographic professions. Position on the page,
use of typographic grids, and genre-specific illustrative conventions should all be taken into
account
