Bowie was the ninth of ten�children born to Elve Ap-Catesby Jones and Rezin Bowie. 
The Bowie children were raised on the frontier and even as small children were expected to help clear the land and plant crops. 
The extent of Bowie's participation is unclear, but he returned to Louisiana before the invasion was repelled by Spanish troops. 
Bowie had supported Wright's opponent in the race for sheriff, and Wright, a bank director, had been instrumental in turning down Bowie's loan application. 
The uninjured Bowie was enraged and tried to kill Wright with his bare hands. 
The attacker hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. 
When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. 
Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. 
Witness accounts agreed that Bowie did not attack first, and the others had focused their attack on Bowie because "they considered him the most dangerous man among their opposition.
There is disagreement among scholars as to whether the knife used in this fight was the same kind of knife now known as a Bowie knife. 
However, in a letter to The Planter's Advocate, Rezin Bowie claimed to have invented the knife, and many Bowie family members as well as "most authorities on the Bowie knife tend to believe it was invented by" Rezin. 
After the Sandbar Fight and subsequent battles in which Bowie successfully used his knife to defend himself, the Bowie knife became very popular. 
The design of the knife continued to evolve, but today a Bowie knife generally is considered to have a blade 8.25�inches (21.0�cm) long and 1.25�inches (3.2�cm) wide, with a curved point, a "sharp false edge cut from both sides", and a cross-guard to protect the user's hands. 
Bowie was elected a commander of the Texas Rangers later that year. 
Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants which could then be sold in bulk to speculators like Bowie. 
Bowie also lied about his age, claiming to be 30 rather than 35. 
Shortly after his marriage Bowie became fascinated with the story of the "lost" Los Almagres Mine, said to be west of San Antonio near the ruin of Santa Cruz de San Sabá Mission. 
The mine had been operated by local Indians before being seized by the Spanish. 
When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one�man, while over 40�Indians had been killed and 30 more wounded. 
The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds. 
Bowie's report of the expedition, written in Spanish, was printed in several newspapers, further establishing his reputation. 
Bowie was forced to flee Monclova and return to the Anglo areas of Texas. 
Although the Mexican army was able to get within 200�yards (183�m), the Texian defensive position protected them from fire. 
The stalemate ended shortly after Bowie led a charge to seize one of the Mexican cannons, at that time only 80�yards (73�m) away. 
Houston offered Bowie a commission as an officer on his staff, but Bowie rejected the opportunity, explaining that he wanted to be in the midst of the fighting. 
He again was turned down, as he "was not an officer of the government nor army." 
After Houston received word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers to defend the Alamo from the expected attack. 
After learning that Santa Anna had 4,500�troops and was heading for the city, Bowie wrote several letters to the provisional government asking for help in defending the Alamo, especially "men, money, rifles, and cannon powder". 
Bowie was older than Travis with a better reputation and considered himself a colonel, thus outranking Travis, a major. 
They chose Bowie, infuriating Travis. 
Travis was disgusted, but two�days later the men agreed to a joint command; Bowie would command the volunteers, and Travis would command the regular army and the volunteer cavalry. 
Bowie had been ill, and two�doctors, including the fort surgeon, were unable to diagnose his illness. 
Travis became the sole commander of the forces when Bowie was confined to bed. 
After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to be burned like a dog, Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre. 
When Bowie's mother was informed of his death, she calmly stated, "I'll wager no wounds were found in his back." 
The soldier maintained that Bowie verbally castigated a Mexican officer in fluent Spanish, and the officer ordered Bowie's tongue cut out and his still-breathing body thrown onto the funeral pyre. 
This account has been disputed by numerous other witnesses, and it is thought to have been invented by the reporter. 
Various other stories circulated, with some witnesses claiming that Bowie shot himself and others saying he was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head. 
Alcalde Ruiz said that Bowie was found "dead in his bed." 
Despite his continual pronouncements of wealth, Bowie's estate was found to be very small. 
Although Bowie's name and his knife were well-known during his lifetime, his legend grew after October 1852, when DeBow's Review published an article written by his brother John Jones Bowie, called "Early Life in the Southwest—The Bowies.
From 1956–1958, Bowie was the subject of a television show, The Adventures of Jim Bowie, which was primarily set in 1830s Louisiana, although later episodes ventured into the Mexican province of Texas. 
Bowie also is the namesake of rock star David Bowie, who was born David Robert Jones. 
He chose the surname Bowie because he admired James Bowie and the Bowie knife. 
Both Bowie, Texas and Bowie County, Texas are named in honor of Jim Bowie.
