NOAA predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 12–16�named storms, of which 6–8 were expected to become hurricanes, and 1–3 expected to become major hurricanes.
On May�15, the hurricane season began in the Eastern Pacific basin, which is the area of the northern Pacific Ocean east of 140ºW. Twelve days later, an area of disturbed weather developed into the first tropical depression of the season, about 190�mi (310�km) south of Acapulco, Mexico.
No tropical storms developed in June in the basin, which was unusual compared to the average of two storms forming during the month.
A large cyclone, its outer rainbands brushed the coastline of Mexico, as it steadily intensified to reach tropical storm and later hurricane status within 30�hours of forming.
As the previous two storms were dissipating, a new tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico on July�16, which would later become Hurricane Daniel.
Daniel was briefly forecast to move through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm; however, the storm continued to weaken, degenerating into a remnant low on July�27 about 800�mi (1290�km)
After dropping moderate rainfall along the peninsula, it weakened further as it turned out to sea, and on July�27 degenerated into a remnant low.
Weakening to a tropical storm on August�20, it later turned sharply to the west, degenerating into a remnant low on August�23 and dissipating the next day without affecting land.
On September�18, an area of disturbed weather in the central Pacific became sufficiently organized and was designated Tropical Depression Two-C. Vertical wind shear caused the depression to weaken into a remnant low on September�20, it never having attained tropical storm status.
The first cyclone to develop in the month of October was Tropical Storm Norman, which formed well off the coast of Mexico on October�9.
Its remnants turned to the east, and on October�15 regenerated into a tropical cyclone just off the coast of Mexico after merging with another disturbance.
The final cyclone to develop within the CPHC area of responsibility was Tropical Depression Four-C, which formed on October�13 to the southwest of Hawaii.
The first storm of the month was Tropical Storm Rosa, which formed on November�8 as a tropical depression off the southwest coast of Mexico.
