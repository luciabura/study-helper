The Tarmarack phase lasted from the year 500 to 1200 and is marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, which indicates development and use of the bow and arrow. 
Displaced Native Americans from the coast of California moved to the Sierra Nevada in the early to mid-19th century. 
The Shoshonean-speaking Monache moved from eastern deserts into the southern Sierra in the last three to five hundred years. 
Significant debate still surrounds the issue of who the first non-indigenous person to see the Valley was. 
The part of the Sierra Nevada where the park is located was long considered to be a physical barrier to non-indigenous settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers. 
That status changed, in 1848, due to the discovery of gold in the foothills west of the range in the California Gold Rush. 
He settled there, and noted that the Paiutes inhabited Hetch Hetchy before the coming of the Europeans. 
The first intentional and systematic exploration of any part of the Yosemite area backcountry was conducted in 1855 by the surveying crew of Allexey W. Von Schmidt, as part of the Public Land Survey System. 
Von Schmidt's charge was to establish the Mount Diablo Base Line from the initial point at Mount Diablo east across the Sierra Nevada, preliminary to the General Land Office (GLO) rectangular survey in California and Nevada. 
This survey was the first crossing of the Sierra Nevada that did not follow established trails or the natural routes suggested by topography. 
In 1863–67, the California Geological Survey surveyed parts of Yosemite's high country and the boundary of the new state park. 
The raiders retreated back in the mountains. 
In 1851 the Mariposa Battalion was created under the authority of the Governor of California to put an end to these raids and starting the Mariposa Wars. 
On Thursday March 27 of that year the company of 50 to 60 men reached what is now called Old Inspiration Point and saw the major features of the Valley laid out before them (they named the overlook Mt. Beatitude). 
Attached to Savage's unit was Dr. Lafayette Bunnell, the company physician who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in The Discovery of the Yosemite. 
While camped at Bridalveil Meadow Bunnell suggested that the Valley be named '"Yo-sem-ity", after what the surrounding Sierra Miwok tribes, who feared the Yosemite Valley tribe, called them. 
The name stuck even though the tribe they named the valley after called themselves Ahwahnechee. 
Bunnell soon after drafted an article about the trip, but destroyed it when a newspaper correspondent in San Francisco suggested cutting his 1500�foot (460�m) height estimate for the Valley walls in half (the walls are in fact twice the height that Bunnell surmised). 
So the first published account of the Valley was written by Lt. Tredwell Moore for the January 20, 1854 issue of the Mariposa Chronicle. 
A group of eight miners entered the Valley in the Spring of 1852 and were allegedly attacked by Tenaya's warriors, with two of the miners being killed. 
In Summer or early Fall of 1853, the Ahwahneechee apparently returned to the Valley, but later betrayed the hospitality of their former Mono hosts by stealing some horses that the Mono had taken from non-indigenous ranchers. 
The museum has exhibits that interpret the cultural history of Yosemite's indigenous residents from 1850 to the present. 
In 1856, Milton and Houston Mann (2 of 42 tourists to visit the valley the year before) finished a toll road to the Valley that traveled up the South Fork of the Merced River. 
Wawona was an indigenous encampment in what is now the southwestern part of the park. 
Clark also provided a way station for tourists traveling on the road that the Mann brothers built to the Valley. 
In 1879, the more substantial Wawona Hotel was built to serve tourists visiting the nearby Grove and those on their way to the Valley (at the time, it took 8 hours to travel from Wawona to the Valley via stage). 
The Washburns, owners of the hotel, bought Clark's land and covered the bridge he built. 
A Unitarian minister named Thomas Starr King visited the Valley in 1860 and saw some of the negative effects that homesteading and commercial activity were having on the area. 
Galen Clark was appointed by the commission as the park's first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners had the authority to evict homesteaders, starting an 11 year struggle. 
Josiah Whitney, the first director of the California Geological Survey, lamented that Yosemite Valley may become like what Niagara Falls was at the time�
The issue was not settled until 1875 when the land holdings of Hutchings and three others were invalidated. 
The long horseback ride needed to reach the area was still a deterrent, so three stagecoach roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access; Coulterville Road (June 1874), Big Oak Flat Road (July 1874), and the Mariposa/Wawona Road (July 1875). 
Clark and the reigning commissioners were ousted in 1880 by the California Legislature and Hutchings became the new park guardian. 
Muir was one of the first to theorize that the major landforms in Yosemite were created by large alpine glaciers, bucking established scientists such as Josiah Whitney who regarded Muir as an amateur (see geology of the Yosemite area). 
His wish was partially answered on October 1, 1890 when the area outside the valley and sequoia grove became a national park under the un-opposed Yosemite Act. 
Muir and 181 others founded the Sierra Club in 1892, in part to lobby for the transfer of the Valley and Grove into the National Park. 
Lacking the legal authority to arrest the herders, the Cavalry instead escorted the shepherds several days hike away from their flock. 
By the late 1890s sheep grazing was no longer a problem, but at least one herder continued grazing his sheep in the park into the 1920s. 
An extensive trail system developed by the Cavalry later formed the basis for the current trails. 
Pre-existing problems in the state park worsened and new problems arose, but the Cavalry could only monitor the situation. 
On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of the Valley and the Grove away from California and give it to the federal government. 
long Wawona Tunnel in 1933 was both an engineering marvel and significantly reduced the amount of travel time to the Valley from Wawona without scarring the landscape with a long road cut (the famous 'Tunnel View' is on the Valley side of the tunnel and Inspiration Point is above it). 
Water rights to Tuolumne River water were first sought by San Francisco in 1901 but were rejected in 1903 by Secretary of the Interior Ethan Allen Hitchcock who felt the application was "not in keeping with the public interest.
" Devastation of the the city by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake tipped the balance. 
The valley was flooded in 1923 by impounding of the Tuolumne River behind the O'Shaughnessy Dam, forming the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. 
The fight over the dam strengthened the conservation movement by popularizing it nationally. 
The largest floods occurred in 1937, 1950, 1955, and 1997, and were in the range of 22,000 to 25,000 cubic feet (620 to 700�m³) per second, as measured at the Pohono Bridge gauging station in Yosemite Valley. 
After the 1950 flood, all structures in Old Yosemite Village, except for the chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished in the 1950s and 1960s. 
Some structures in the Old Village, such as the historic 1858 Cedar Cottage, then the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, were demolished even though they weren't flooded. 
The Firefall was occasionally performed in the 1870s and became a nightly tradition with the founding of Camp Curry. 
The broader tensions in American society were felt in Yosemite in 1970, when a large number of youths gathered in the park over the summer. 
The late 1990s saw the high-profile murder case of Cary Stayner and some serious rock slides; one rockslide originating from the east side of Glacier Point ended near the Happy Isles of the Merced River, creating a debris field larger than several football fields. 
In the 1860s there were over 750�acres (300�ha) of meadows in the valley compared to 340�acres (140�ha) by the end of the 20th century. 
Muir wrote that even the "... frivolous and inappreciative ..." visitors were on the whole "... a most hopeful sign of the times, indicating at least the beginning of our return to nature—for going to the mountains is going home." 
In March 1986 the California Department of Fish and Game, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Forest Service reintroduced Bighorn Sheep just east of the park in Lee Vining Canyon. 
The herd reached a peak of nearly 100 individuals in 1994, but almost 60% of the herd died in the winter of 1994–1995. 
About 55 bighorns from the herd were counted in the 1996 census. 
Brown Bears, also called grizzlies, were once the top predators in the region but went locally extinct in the 1920s. 
Yet there were still 1300 buildings in the valley and 17�acres (6.9�ha) of the valley floor were covered by parking lots in the late 1990s. 
Plans for reducing the human impact on the park were released by the Park Service in 1980. 
The Story and the Process". 
Proposals to exclude cars in the summer that are not registered at a hotel or campsite within the valley have been investigated (this has already been implemented at other parks, such as Zion National Park in Utah). 
Ironically, only about 14 square miles (36�km²) of the 1,200�mi² of the park are visited by a majority of the people.
