At 09 40, the commander of Group C called up various reinforcements from Hu√© including two companies of Vietnamese trainee NCOs and five infantry companies, two of which came via landing craft and did not reach the beleaguered elements of Group C until 18 00, half an hour after the Moroccans had finally counter attacked and occupied Phu An.
During this battle, however, most of the Regiment 95 personnel who had been elsewhere managed to escape towards the southern end of the French encirclement.
By early summer 1953, thanks in part to the wind down of hostilities in the Korean War, the French command had sufficient reserves at hand to begin clearing the Viet Minh back from Road One.
