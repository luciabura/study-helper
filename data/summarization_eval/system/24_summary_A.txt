The rest of the teeth were oval in cross section, rather than blade like as in most other theropods.
In several smaller specimens of Gorgosaurus, the tibia was longer than the femur, a proportion typical of fast running animals.
Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to synonymize the two genera.
