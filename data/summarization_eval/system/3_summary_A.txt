Twelve days later, an area of disturbed weather developed into the first tropical depression of the season, about 190�mi (310�km) south of Acapulco, Mexico.
Wind shear weakened the storm, and on May�31 Aletta dissipated about 200�mi (320�km) west-northwest of where it formed.
In the Eastern Pacific, Tropical Depression Two-E formed on June�3 about 145�mi (245�km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Mexico.
The first storm of the month was Hurricane Bud, which developed early on July�11 about 805�mi (1300�km) south of Cabo San Lucas.
Bud continued strengthening, reaching major hurricane status, or Category�3 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and peak winds of 125�mph (205�km/h) on July�13.
On July�14, Bud weakened to tropical storm status, and two days later it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area.
One day after Bud formed, a tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression about 290�mi (465�km) off the coast of Mexico, which would later become Hurricane Carlotta.
A large cyclone, its outer rainbands brushed the coastline of Mexico, as it steadily intensified to reach tropical storm and later hurricane status within 30�hours of forming.
As the previous two storms were dissipating, a new tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico on July�16, which would later become Hurricane Daniel.
On July�22, it attained peak winds of 150�mph (240�km/h), a Category�4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and making Daniel the strongest hurricane during the season in the NHC area of responsibility.
Daniel was briefly forecast to move through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm; however, the storm continued to weaken, degenerating into a remnant low on July�27 about 800�mi (1290�km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii.
It tracked northward toward the coast, strengthening into Tropical Storm Emilia and attaining peak winds of 65�mph (105�km/h).
Fabio degenerated into a remnant low on August�4, and a few days later brought locally heavy rainfall to Hawaii.
Gilma developed on August�1 off the southwest coast of Mexico, attaining peak winds of 40�mph (65�km/h).
Weakening to a tropical storm on August�20, it later turned sharply to the west, degenerating into a remnant low on August�23 and dissipating the next day without affecting land.
Encountering warm waters and little wind shear, and maintaining well-defined outflow, Ioke intensified from a tropical depression to Category�4 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale within 48�hours.
On August�21 shortly after the previous storm formed, Hurricane Ileana developed off the southwest coast of Mexico.
The next tropical depression, which would eventually become Hurricane John, formed on August�28 about 250�mi (400�km) off the coast of Mexico.
Hurricane John continued rapid intensification and reached peak winds of 135�mph (215�km/h) on August�30 while just off the Mexican coast.
The last storm to develop in August was Hurricane Kristy, which formed on August�30 about 935�mi (1505�km) west-northwest of Hurricane John.
Kristy later turned to the west, oscillating between tropical depression and tropical storm status until dissipating on September�9.
Vertical wind shear caused the depression to weaken into a remnant low on September�20, it never having attained tropical storm status.
However, wind shear and the presence of dry air to the west inhibited further development, and the system dissipated 12�hours later; at around the same time, the system crossed into the Western Pacific.
The first cyclone to develop in the month of October was Tropical Storm Norman, which formed well off the coast of Mexico on October�9.
It quickly reached peak winds of 50�mph (85�km/h), though almost as quickly the cyclone degenerated into a remnant low due to wind shear.
Tracking northeastward and attaining tropical storm status, it failed to strengthen significantly due to wind shear.
Olivia weakened to tropical depression status on October�11, and turning to the east-southeast degenerated into a remnant low two days later.
The final cyclone to develop within the CPHC area of responsibility was Tropical Depression Four-C, which formed on October�13 to the southwest of Hawaii.
However, a decrease in shear allowed Paul to strengthen rapidly, and in a 24-hour period it developed from a moderate tropical storm to a 105�mph (170�km/h) hurricane, its peak intensity.
On October�26 shortly after Paul dissipated, another tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico.
Immediate development was hampered by wind shear, although an increase in thunderstorms on November�9 brought the depression to tropical storm status.
On November�11, another tropical depression formed off the coast of Mexico, about 450�mi (720�km) west-southwest of where Rosa dissipated the previous day.
Sergio later turned to the west, remaining well off the coast of Mexico, and dissipated on November�20 about 320�mi (515�km) west-northwest of it originally formed.
Of the six storms that affected Mexico but did not strike the country, the first was Tropical Storm Aletta, the first storm of the season, which brought light rainfall and caused minor damage.
The remnants of Tropical Storm Fabio contributed to heavy rainfall, peaking at 15.08�in (383�mm) on Mount Waiʻaleʻale on the island of Kauai; the rainfall caused river and roadway flooding, but little damage.
