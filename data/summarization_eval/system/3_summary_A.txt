Weakening to a tropical storm on August 20, it later turned sharply to the west, degenerating into a remnant low on August 23 and dissipating the next day without affecting land.
On September 18, an area of disturbed weather in the central Pacific became sufficiently organized and was designated Tropical Depression Two C. Vertical wind shear caused the depression to weaken into a remnant low on September 20, it never having attained tropical storm status.
As the previous two storms were dissipating, a new tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico on July 16, which would later become Hurricane Daniel.
