El Greco received his initial training as an icon painter of the Cretan school, the leading centre of post Byzantine art.
The extensive archival research conducted since the early 1960s by scholars, such as Nikolaos Panayotakis, Pandelis Prevelakis and Maria Constantoudaki, indicates strongly that El Greco's family and ancestors were Greek Orthodox.
Clovio characterized El Greco as a rare talent in painting .
In 1570, El Greco moved to Rome, where he executed a series of works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship.
Unlike other Cretan artists who had moved to Venice, El Greco substantially altered his style and sought to distinguish himself by inventing new and unusual interpretations of traditional religious subject matter.
His works painted in Italy were influenced by the Venetian Renaissance style of the period, with agile, elongated figures reminiscent of Tintoretto and a chromatic framework that connects him to Titian.
Clovio reports visiting El Greco on a summer's day while the artist was still in Rome.
By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount and left little room for different approaches.
Although the artistic heritage of these great masters was overwhelming for young painters, El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style.
When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint .
Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League.
By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works The Purification of the Temple , El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but advanced the claim to rival these masters.
In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.
A few months later, on September 18, 1572, El Greco paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter.
In 1577, El Greco emigrated first to Madrid, then to Toledo, where he produced his mature works.
Through Clovio and Orsini, El Greco met Benito Arias Montano, a Spanish humanist and agent of Philip; Pedro Chacón, a clergyman; and Luis de Castilla, son of Diego de Castilla, the dean of the Cathedral of Toledo.
Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that El Greco's works violated a basic rule of the Counter Reformation, namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style.
Lacking the favor of the king, El Greco was obliged to remain in Toledo, where he had been received in 1577 as a great painter.
Between 1607 and 1608 El Greco was involved in a protracted legal dispute with the authorities of the Hospital of Charity at Illescas concerning payment for his work, which included painting, sculpture and architecture; i this and other legal disputes contributed to the economic difficulties he experienced towards the end of his life.
According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless in execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style.
A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface.
Modern scholarly research emphasizes the importance of Toledo for the complete development of El Greco's mature style and stresses the painter's ability to adjust his style in accordance with his surroundings.
He believes that in El Greco's mature works the devotional intensity of mood reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain in the period of the Counter Reformation .
Since the beginning of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins.
The English art historian David Davies seeks the roots of El Greco's style in the intellectual sources of his Greek Christian education and in the world of his recollections from the liturgical and ceremonial aspect of the Orthodox Church.
El Greco is regarded as a painter who incorporated architecture in his painting.
El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th century Mannerism.
The physicians August Goldschmidt and Germán Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems possibly progressive astigmatism or strabismus that made him see bodies longer than they were, and at an angle to the perpendicular; l the physician Arturo Perera, however, attributed this style to the use of marijuana.
According to Efi Foundoulaki, painters and theoreticians from the beginning of the 20th century 'discovered' a new El Greco but in process they also discovered and revealed their own selves .
Several traits of cubism, such as distortions and the materialistic rendering of time, have their analogies in El Greco's work.
On February 22, 1950, Picasso began his series of paraphrases of other painters' works with The Portrait of a Painter after El Greco.
Kysa Johnson used El Greco's paintings of the Immaculate Conception as the compositional framework for some of her works, and the master's anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut's portraits.
The life of the Cretan born artist is the subject of the recent film El Greco of Greek, Spanish and British production.
In 1937, a highly influential study by art historian Rodolfo Pallucchini had the effect of greatly increasing the number of works accepted to be by El Greco.
There was consensus that the triptych was indeed an early work of El Greco and, therefore, Pallucchini's publication became the yardstick for attributions to the artist.
Wethey and other scholars rejected the notion that Crete took any part in his formation and supported the elimination of a series of works from El Greco's oeuvre.
Since 1962, the discovery of the Dormition and the extensive archival research has gradually convinced scholars that Wethey's assessments were not entirely correct, and that his catalogue decisions may have distorted the perception of the whole nature of El Greco's origins, development and oeuvre.
El Greco is now seen as an artist with a formative training on Crete; a series of works illuminate the style of early El Greco, some painted while he was still in Crete, some from his period in Venice, and some from his subsequent stay in Rome.
Even Wethey accepted that he El Greco probably had painted the little and much disputed triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena before he left Crete .
Nevertheless, disputes over the exact number of El Greco's authentic works remain unresolved, and the status of Wethey's catalogue raisonné is at the centre of these disagreements.
There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, The Crucifixion.
