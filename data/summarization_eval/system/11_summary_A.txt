The placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the Miocene, when Australia moved closer to Indonesia, and bats and rodents started to appear reliably in the fossil record.[citation needed] The marsupials evolved to fill specific ecological niches, and in many cases they are physically similar to the placental mammals in Eurasia and North America that occupy similar niches, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.
Relatively recent colonists from Eurasia are swallows,[citation needed] larks, thrushes, cisticolas, sunbirds, and some raptors, including the large Wedge-tailed Eagle.[citation needed] A number of bird species have been introduced by humans; some, like the European Goldfinch and Greenfinch, coexist happily with Australian species,[citation needed] while others, such as the Common Starling, Common Blackbird, House Sparrow and Indian Mynah, are destructive of some native bird species and thus destabilise the native ecosystem.
About two million birds travel this route to and from Australia each year.[citation needed] One very common large seabird is the Australian Pelican, which can be found in most waterways in Australia.
The Myobatrachidae, or southern frogs, are Australia's largest group of frogs, with 120 species from 21 genera.[citation needed] A notable member of this group is the colourful and endangered Corroboree Frog.
Of these, the most venomous species,[citation needed] including the Fierce Snake, Eastern Brown Snake, Taipan and Eastern Tiger Snake are from the family Elapidae.
Of the 200 species of elapid, 86 are found only in Australia.[citation needed] Thirty-three sea snakes from family Hydrophiidae inhabit Australia's northern waters; many are extremely venomous.
Australia has only 11 species from the world's most significant snake family Colubridae; none are endemic, and they are considered to be relatively recent arrivals from Asia.
There are 15 python species and 31 species of insectivorous blind snake.[citation needed] There are more lizards in Australia than anywhere else in the world,[citation needed] with representatives of five families.
There are 26 species of monitor lizard,[citation needed] family Varanidae, in Australia, where they are commonly known as goannas.
There are 389 species of skink from 38 genera, comprising about 50% of the total Australian lizard fauna;[citation needed] this group includes the blue-tongued lizards.
However, because of the relative scarcity of freshwater waterways, Australia has only 170 species of freshwater fish.[citation needed] Two families of freshwater fish have ancient origins: the arowana or "bony tongues," and the Queensland lungfish.
Other families with a potentially Gondwanan origin include the Retropinnidae, Galaxiidae, Aplochitonidae and Percichthyidae.[citation needed]Apart from the ancient freshwater species, 70% of Australia's freshwater fish have affinities with tropical Indo-Pacific marine species that have adapted to freshwater.
Several exotic freshwater fish species, including brown, brook and rainbow trout, Atlantic and Chinook salmon, redfin perch, carp and mosquitofish, have been introduced to Australian waterways.
The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of upland native fish species including trout cod, Macquarie perch and galaxias species as well as other upland fauna such as the Spotted Tree Frog.
The carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of southwest Australia.[citation needed] Most of Australia's fish species are marine.[citation needed] Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch.
There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters,[citation needed] including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the Giant Grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7�m and weigh up to 400�kg.
The largest group of invertebrates is the insects, comprising 75% of Australia's known species of animals.
In the Annelida (sub)class Oligochaeta there are many families of aquatic worms, and for native terrestrial worms: the Enchytraeidae (pot worms) and the "true" earthworms in families Acanthodrilidae, Octochaetidae and Megascolecidae.[citation needed] The latter includes the world's largest earthworm, the giant Gippsland earthworm, found only in Gippsland, Victoria.
On average they reach 80�cm in length, but specimens up to 3.7�m in length have been found.[citation needed] The large family Parastacidae includes 124 species of Australian freshwater crayfish.[citation needed] These include the world's smallest crayfish, the swamp crayfish, which does not exceed 30�mm in length, and the world's largest crayfish, the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish, measuring up to 76�cm long and weighing 4.5�kg.
A huge variety of marine invertebrates are found in Australian waters, with the Great Barrier Reef an important source of this diversity.[citation needed] Families include the Porifera or sea sponges, the Cnidaria (includes the jellyfish, corals and sea anemones, comb jellies), the Echinodermata (includes the sea urchins, sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, the lamp shells) and the Mollusca (includes snails, slugs, limpets, squid, octopus, cockles, oysters, clams, and chitons).
Venomous invertebrates include the box jellyfish, the blue-ringed octopus, and ten species of cone snail,[citation needed] which can cause respiratory failure and death in humans.
This presents a serious reef management issue.[citation needed] Other problematic marine invertebrates include the native species purple sea-urchin and the white urchin, which have been able to take over marine habitats and form urchin barrens due to the over harvesting of their natural predators which include abalone and rock lobster.[citation needed] Introduced invertebrate pests include the Asian mussel, New Zealand green-lipped mussel, black-striped mussel and the Northern Pacific seastar, all of which displace native shellfish.[citation needed] There are many unique marine crustaceans in Australian waters.
The best-known class, to which all the edible species of crustacean belong, is Malacostraca.[citation needed] The warm waters of northern Australia are home to many species of decapod crustaceans, including crabs, false crabs, hermit crabs, lobsters, shrimps, and prawns.
The Peracarids, including the amphipods and isopods, are more diverse in the colder waters of southern Australia.[citation needed] Less-well-known marine groups include the classes Remipedia, Cephalocarida, Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (which includes the barnacles, copepods and fish lice), and the Ostracoda.
Notable species include the Tasmanian giant crab, the second largest crab species in the world,[citation needed] found in deep water, and weighing up to 13�kg, and the Australian spiny lobsters, such as the Western rock lobster, which are distinct from other lobster species as they do not have claws.
The invasive species include birds (Indian Mynah) and fish (common carp), insects (red imported fire ant) and molluscs (Asian mussel).
