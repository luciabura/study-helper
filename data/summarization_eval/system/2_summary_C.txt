The Morrill Act, signed into law July 2, 1862, was created to enable states to establish colleges where the "leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts...in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life". 
The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, known as Texas A.M.C., was established by the state legislature on April 17, 1871 as the state's first public institution of higher education. 
Enrollment, which had climbed as high as 500�students, declined to only 80�students in 1883, the year the University of Texas opened in Austin, Texas. 
Although the Texas Constitution specified that the Agricultural and Mechanical College was to be a branch of a proposed University of Texas, the Austin school was established with a separate Board of Regents. 
Texas A.M.C. president Lawrence Sullivan Ross, known affectionately to students as "Sully", is credited for saving the school from closure and transforming it into a respected military institution. 
Ross, the immediate past governor of Texas, had been a well-respected Confederate Brigadier General and enjoyed a good reputation among state residents. 
When Ross arrived at the school, he found no running water, a housing shortage, a disgruntled faculty, and many students running wild. 
Texas A&M graduates were called to use their military training during World War I, and by 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, a larger percentage than any other college or university. 
The first graduate school was organized in 1924, and, in 1925, Mary Evelyn Crawford Locke became the first female to receive a diploma from Texas A&M, although she was not allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony. 
In 1926, they codified that women in summer school had an unofficial status and could not pursue a degree. 
During the Depression, as professors were forced to accept a 25% pay cut, the Board of Directors partially rescinded its order against female enrollment, allowing no more than 20 females at a time to enroll in the school, and further restricting the group to daughters of professors. 
World War II gave Texas A&M an opportunity to prove itself on a worldwide stage. 
Though Texas A&M was originally established as a branch of the yet-to-be-created University of Texas, subsequent acts of the Texas Legislature never gave the University any authority over Texas A&M. 
This internal legal conflict in Texas was nullified in 1948 when Texas A&M became the flagship school of the newly created Texas A&M University System, a clear and separate institution from the University of Texas System. 
Unprepared for the growth, between 1949 and 1953 Texas A&M used the former Bryan Air Force Base as an extension of the campus. 
At the time, the college was still an all-male military school with a 7,500 student enrollment. 
The wives and daughters of faculty, staff and students as well as female staff members were finally allowed to officially participate in undergraduate programs, although they were not permitted to join the Corps of Cadets. 
On September 17, 1971, Texas A&M University was one of the first four institutions to be designated a sea-grant college in recognition of oceanographic development and research. 
A third designation was added on August 31, 1989 when Texas A&M was named a space-grant college. 
The university remains one of few institutions nationwide to hold designations as a land-, sea-, and space-grant college. 
At the time, the women were segregated into a special unit, known as W-1, and suffered harassment from many of their male counterparts. 
These groups were opened to female participation in 1988, following a federal court decision in a class-action lawsuit filed by a female cadet. 
The school, offers a master's degree in public policy and one in international affairs as well as two research degrees, officially launched in 1997. 
A commission put together by Texas A&M University discovered that a number of factors led to the Bonfire collapse, including "excessive internal stresses" on the logs and "inadequate containment strength", where the wiring used to tie the logs together was not strong enough. 
In 1997, university president Ray Bowen appointed a task force to create a new strategic plan for the university. 
Vision 2020's goal is to make Texas A&M University recognized as a consensus "top 10" public university by the year 2020. 
Less than three weeks later, Reed Arena was again opened as a temporary shelter for people fleeing Hurricane Rita.
