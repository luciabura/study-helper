660�kW turbines recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity over the course of a year. 
There are now numerous large on-shore power stations including Black Law Wind Farm rated at over 96 MW, Hadyard Hill Wind Farm, which is the first wind farm in the UK able to generate over 100 MW, and Whitelee Wind Farm, a 322 MW project that is the largest onshore wind farm in Europe. 
Wind Energy were awarded development contracts by the Crown Estate as part of a UK-wide initiative. 
Future wave farm projects could involve an arrangement of interlinked 750�kW machines connected to shore by a subsea transmission cable. 
It is a shore-based unit and generates power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. 
It will be the world's largest, with a capacity of 3 MW generated by four Pelamis machines at a cost of over 4 million pounds. 
The funding is part of a new £13 million funding package for marine power projects in Scotland that will also support developments to Aquamarine's Oyster and Ocean Power Technology's PowerBuoy wave systems, AWS Ocean Energy's sub-sea wave devices, ScotRenewables' 1.2 MW floating rotor device, Cleantechcom's tidal surge plans for the Churchill barriers between various Orkney islands, the Open Hydro tidal ring turbines, and further developments to the Wavegen system proposed for Lewis as well as a further £2.5 million for the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) based in Orkney. 
This is a new Scottish Executive-backed research facility that has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney mainland and a tidal power testing station on the nearby island of Eday. 
At the official opening of the Eday project the site was described as "the first of its kind in the world set up to provide developers of wave and tidal energy devices with a purpose-built performance testing facility." 
Today it is known that a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. 
Numerous remote straths were flooded by these schemes, many of the largest of which involved tunneling through mountains as well as damming rivers. 
Emma Wood, the author of a study of these pioneers wrote: Current capacity is 1.33 GW and includes major developments such as the 120 MW Breadalbane scheme and the 245 MW Tummel system. 
A major benefit of biodiesel is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels is a matter of controversy. 
Due to the relatively short growing season for sugar producing crops, ethanol is not commercially produced as a fuel in Scotland at present. 
Anaerobic digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray. 
Landfill sites have the potential for a further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential. 
The energy company E.ON has constructed a 44 MW biomass power station at Lockerbie using locally sourced crops while the smaller but not insignificant EPR Westfield power plant in Fife produces 9.8 MW of output using chicken litter as fuel. 
The Forestry Commission are developing a Scottish Biomass Action Plan in conjunction with the Scottish Executive, and the latter is expected to provide a £7.5 million grant scheme to support biomass energy. 
There is growing demand for automatic wood pellet boilers which can be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems, and which may be cheaper to run as well as being carbon neutral. 
There is also local potential for energy crops such as short-rotation willow or poplar coppice, miscanthus energy grass, agricultural wastes such as straw and manure, and forestry residues. 
The Energy Savings Trust has estimated that micro-generation could provide a significantly increased proportion of the UK's electricity demand by 2050 although only a fraction of this would come from renewable sources. 
Small-scale 'wind2heat' projects, which use wind turbines to power electrical storage heaters directly, have proven to be successful in remoter rural areas; as have various other local schemes such as air source heat pumps. 
This water can be stored in an underground aquifer and the heat extracted in winter using a heat pump. 
Water in a coal mine 
Various other ideas for renewable energy in the early stages of development, such as ocean thermal energy conversion, deep lake water cooling, and blue energy, have received little attention in Scotland, presumably because the potential is so significant for less speculative technologies. 
However, there is likely to be a greater level of credibility inherent in a nearby and visible scheme than in a far-distant one. 
It is not a form of renewable energy production, but it may be a way to significantly reduce the effect of fossil fuels whilst renewables are commercialised. 
It may also be an intermediate step towards a 'hydrogen economy' (see below), which could either enable further renewable development or conceivably out-compete it. 
It is not a form of renewable energy production, although like carbon sequestration it offers a significant commercial challenge to renewable developments. 
However, a plan to build a new "clean coal" power station at Hunterston collapsed in 2009 after financial backing was withdrawn. 
Nuclear power: Renewable energy as a concept generally excludes nuclear power although this stance has been challenged. 
Although hydrogen offers significant potential as an alternative to hydrocarbons as a carrier of energy, neither hydrogen itself nor the associated fuel cell technologies are sources of energy in themselves. 
The PURE project on Unst in Shetland is a ground-breaking training and research centre which uses a combination of the ample supplies of wind power and fuel cells to create a wind hydrogen system. 
Two 15�kW turbines are attached to a 'Hypod' fuel cell, which in turn provides power for heating systems, the creation of stored liquid hydrogen and an innovative fuel-cell driven car. 
In the Western Isles a plan to enable a £10 million waste management plant into a hydrogen production facility was announced in June 2006. 
It is a division of ITI Scotland, which also includes a life sciences and digital media division. 
There is clearly a significant difference between a renewable energy production facility of modest size providing an island community with all its energy needs, and an industrial scale power station in the same location that is designed to export power to far distant urban locations. 
The matter went to a public inquiry and has been described by Ian Johnston of The Scotsman as a "battle that pitches environmentalists against conservationists and giant energy companies against aristocratic landowners and clan chiefs". 
Scotland, as a relatively sparsely populated country with significant renewable resources, is in a unique position to demonstrate how the transition to a low-carbon, widely distributed energy economy may be undertaken. 
The Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland, (FREDS) is a partnership between industry, academia and Government aimed at enabling Scotland to capitalise on its renewable energy resource. 
In 2009 AREG formed an alliance with North Scotland Industries Group to help promote the North of Scotland as an "international renewable energy hub". 
In January 2008 it was reported that Professor Graeme Walker of the University of Abertay is leading a project aimed at using grain that is a by-product of whisky distilling as a biofuel. 
In January 2009 the government announced the launch of a "Marine Spatial Plan" to map the potential of the Pentland Firth and Orkney coasts and agreed to take part in a working group examining options for an offshore grid to connect renewable energy projects in the North Sea to on-shore national grids. 
The former is an estimate of the maximum productive output of a given technology or individual generation station at a single point in time. 
The latter takes into account the likely intermittency of energy supply and is a measure of output over a period of time. 
Thus, for example, individual wind turbines may have a 'capacity factor' of between 15% and 45% depending on their location, with a higher capacity factor giving a greater potential energy output for a given installed capacity. 
The 'potential energy' column is thus an estimate based on a variety of assumptions including the installed capacity.
