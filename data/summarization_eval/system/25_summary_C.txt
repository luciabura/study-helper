The rocks exposed in Bryce Canyon are about 100 million years younger than those in nearby Zion National Park, and the rocks exposed in Zion are younger than those in the Grand Canyon to the south. 
As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from being part of the Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway. 
Called the Dakota Sandstone, it is the oldest formation exposed in the Bryce Canyon area but the youngest one exposed in the Zion and Kolob canyons area to the southwest. 
In the Bryce Canyon area this formation can be seen in the Paria Valley where it is found as a lithified blanket sand that probably accumulated on beaches, in lagoons, and vast coal-producing swamps as the Cretaceous Seaway transgressed (advanced inland) over the region and later retreated. 
The resulting dark gray to black Tropic Shale records the maximum transgression of the seaway into Utah and is 1,000�feet (300�m) thick in the Paria Amphitheater. 
The Cretaceous Seaway was already retreating east and to the south by the time the locally 1,700�feet (520�m) thick Straight Cliffs Formation was deposited. 
While the alternating layers of shale and sandstone mixed with massive coal deposits of the John Henry Member were laid down in swamps, lagoons and fluvial environments one member, the Drip Tank, is not found in the Bryce Canyon area. 
The shales and sandstones of the locally 700�feet (210�m) thick Wahweap Formation were deposited in moving water (fluvial setting). 
This formation is up to 100�feet (30�m) thick in the Bryce Canyon area but other parts of the Kaiparowits in the region are several hundreds of feet (tens of meters) thick. 
All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited. 
These sediments were later lithified into the up to 700�feet (210�m) thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene-aged Claron Formation (previously called the Wasatch Formation). 
The limey ooses and mud were later lithified into the limestone and interbedded siltstone of the up to 300�foot (90�m) thick White Member of the Claron. 
A gap in the geologic record following deposition of the Claron Formation was interrupted 34 to 31�mya by eruptions from the nearby Marysvale volcanic field, which is located northwest of the park. 
Volcanic ash and lava from these flows are found less than 20�miles (30�km) from Bryce Canyon but at least some volcanic material was likely deposited directly in the park area only to be later removed by erosion. 
Basaltic rocks of the same age can be seen along the Sevier Fault near the entrance to Red Canyon; the dark colored volcanic rocks have been displaced by the fault some 900�feet (300�m) and are now in direct contact with the much older Claron Formation. 
Younger rock units were laid down but were mostly removed by subsequent uplift-accelerated erosion. 
Among these are the 50- to 100-foot-thick (15 to 30�m) Oligocene or Miocene-aged Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Pliocene to early Pleistocene-aged Sevier River Formation. 
The brownish-gray sandstone and gravels of the Sevier River Formation were laid down in valleys that were part of the ancestral Sevier River drainage system. 
Around 15�mya in Miocene time, tensional forces in Nevada to the west were so great that the crust was spread thin, creating the Basin and Range Province. 
Long, north–south-trending normal faults were either newly created or reactivated from older pre-existing faults; a plateau rose on one side of each fault while valleys subsided on the other as the crust was extended in an east-west direction. 
An alternate theory is that the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau. 
Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete. 
In the case of Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 2–4�feet (0.6–1.3�m) every 100 years.
