Australia and its territories are home to around 800 species of bird; about 350 of these are endemic to the zoogeographic region that covers Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand.[citation needed] 
The fossil record of birds in Australia is patchy; however, there are records of the ancestors of contemporary species as early as the Late Oligocene. 
A number of bird species have been introduced by humans; some, like the European Goldfinch and Greenfinch, coexist happily with Australian species,[citation needed] while others, such as the Common Starling, Common Blackbird, House Sparrow and Indian Mynah, are destructive of some native bird species and thus destabilise the native ecosystem. 
One very common large seabird is the Australian Pelican, which can be found in most waterways in Australia. 
The tree frogs, from family Hylidae, are common in high rainfall areas on the north and east coasts; there are 77 Australian species from three genera.[citation needed] 
The 18 species from two genera[citation needed] of the Microhylidae frogs are restricted to the rainforests; the smallest species, the Scanty Frog, is from this family.[citation needed] 
The Saltwater Crocodile, known colloquially as the "salty," is the largest living crocodile species; reaching over 7�m, and weighing over 1,000�kg, they can and do kill people. 
The Australian coast is visited by six species of sea turtle: the Flatback, Green Sea, Hawksbill, Olive Ridley, Loggerhead and the Leatherback Sea Turtles; all are protected in Australian waters. 
There are 29 species of Australian freshwater turtles from eight genera of family Chelidae.[citation needed] 
Of the 200 species of elapid, 86 are found only in Australia.[citation needed] 
Australia has only 11 species from the world's most significant snake family Colubridae; none are endemic, and they are considered to be relatively recent arrivals from Asia. 
There are 15 python species and 31 species of insectivorous blind snake.[citation needed] 
There are 26 species of monitor lizard,[citation needed] family Varanidae, in Australia, where they are commonly known as goannas. 
The largest Australian monitor is the Perentie, which can reach up to 2�m in length. 
Two species of endangered freshwater shark are found in the Northern Territory. 
There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters,[citation needed] including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the Giant Grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7�m and weigh up to 400�kg. 
The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. 
There are 11 venomous species of stingray,[citation needed] the largest of which is the smooth stingray. 
The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species. 
There are 166 species, including 30 species of requiem shark, 32 of catshark, six of wobbegong shark, and 40 of dogfish shark. 
In 2004, there were 12 unprovoked shark attacks in Australia, of which two were fatal. 
A megamouth shark was found on a Perth beach in 1988; very little is known about this species, but this discovery may indicate the presence of the species in Australian coastal waters. 
Of the estimated 200,000 animal species in Australia, about 96% are invertebrates. 
There are numerous highly venomous species, including the notorious Sydney funnel-web and redback spiders, whose bites can be deadly. 
Species from the genus Engaeus, commonly known as the land crayfish, are also found in Australia. 
Notable species include the Tasmanian giant crab, the second largest crab species in the world,[citation needed] found in deep water, and weighing up to 13�kg, and the Australian spiny lobsters, such as the Western rock lobster, which are distinct from other lobster species as they do not have claws. 
The impact of Aborigines on native species populations is widely considered to be less significant than that of the European settlers, whose impact on the landscape has been on a relatively large scale. 
Much of Australia's fauna is protected by legislation;[citation needed] a notable exception is kangaroos, which are prolific and are regularly culled. 
At present, 380 animal species are classified as either endangered or threatened under the EPBC Act, and other species are protected under state and territory legislation. 
The key is understanding of Australia's diverse wildlife and fauna; what seems safe is often deadly. 
Australia is a member of the International Whaling Commission and is strongly opposed to commercial whaling—all Cetacean species are protected in Australian waters. 
Some of Australia's fisheries are already overexploited, and quotas have been set for the sustainable harvest of many marine species.
