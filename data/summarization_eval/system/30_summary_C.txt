Contributions to expand the fund were encouraged. 
The cost of the migration was expected to be reduced by one-third. 
Built to Brigham Young's design, the handcarts resembled a large wheelbarrow, with two wheels five feet (1.5�m) in diameter and a single axle four and half feet (1.4�m) wide, and weighing 60 pounds (27�kg). 
Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9�m) crossbar at the front. 
The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. 
Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9�m by 1.2�m), with 8 inch (0.2�m) walls. 
Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood ("Iowa hickory or oak"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements. 
Provisions for each group of one hundred emigrants were carried in an ox wagon, and were distributed by the tent captains. 
The captains were missionaries returning to their homes in Utah and were familiar with the route. 
Most of the sub-captains were also returning missionaries. 
The first three companies were regarded as having demonstrated the feasibility of emigrating using handcarts. 
The late departures may have been the result of difficulties in procuring ships in response to the unexpected demand, but the results would be tragic. 
Critical weeks were spent hastily assembling the carts and outfitting the companies. 
In early October the two companies reached Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were there for them. 
Throughout October more wagon trains were assembled, and by the end of the month 250 relief wagons were on the road. 
A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them a small amount of flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company. 
The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. 
At Devil's Gate the rescue party unloaded the baggage carried in the wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that had been following the Martin Company so the wagons could be used to transport the weakest emigrants. 
On November 4 the company had to cross the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 90 to 120 feet (27 to 37 m) wide. 
The stream was clogged with floating ice. 
When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. 
At last all the members of the handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. 
American West historian, Wallace Stegner, described the inadequate planning and improvident decisions leading to the tragedy when he wrote, As early as November 2, 1856, while the Willie and Martin companies were still making their way to safety, Brigham Young responded to criticism of his own leadership by rebuking Franklin Richards and Daniel Spencer for allowing the companies to leave so late. 
Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? 
The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company.
there is evidence of negligence. 
" On the other hand, Rebecca Bartholomew and Leonard J. Arrington wrote, "Memories of what was perhaps the worst disaster in the history of western migration have been palliated by what could also be regarded as the most heroic rescue of the Mormon frontier." 
The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. 
The handcarts would now be regularly greased. 
The emigrants were now able to travel by rail to Saint Joseph, Missouri, after which they went by riverboat to Florence where they were outfitted with handcarts and supplies. 
After 1860 handcarts were no longer used. 
The transcontinental railroad was being constructed, and the railroad terminus gradually moved westward, shortening the trip. 
The reenactments have been lauded by LDS leaders; for example, M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said, "Through music, drama, and stirring reenactments, we will be reminded of incredible pioneer journeys, both temporal and spiritual."
