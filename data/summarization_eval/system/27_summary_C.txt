The remains of British Iron Age farms have been found at Chapel Lane, a site now protected as a public open space by the district and parish councils and supported by Navenby Archaeology Group. 
The Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village, and a possible Romano-British temple and burial sites have been unearthed in the area. 
The Vikings exerted considerable influence over Lincolnshire in the 9th and 10th centuries, as can be seen in the many local place names ending in -by. 
Navenby, originally an agricultural village, became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. 
Today, the square has gone and the cross is a ruin. 
The documents show the village hosted several annual fairs each year: a market fair on 17 October at which farm animals were traded; a feast on the Thursday before Easter; and a Hiring Fair held each May Day, at which servants gathered to seek employment. 
Such was the significance of Navenby at this time that a workhouse for the parish poor was erected here, although the building was later given over to other uses. 
When the market closed in the early 19th century Navenby lost its status as a market town, and once again became an agricultural village. 
The Penny Cyclopaedia of 1839, published by The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, described the village in this way: 
The Provincial Gas Light and Coke Company began supplying gas lighting to the village in 1857, and in 1867 a railway station was built three-quarters of a mile (1.2�km) west of the village, on the Lincoln-to-Grantham branch of the Great Northern Railway. 
By 1871, the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln was the principal landowner and Lord of the Manor of Navenby. 
Navenby was an agricultural village at the beginning of the 20th century, but the outbreak of the First World War brought changes for the community. 
The base served as a satellite field for RAF Digby until 1944 and as a relief landing ground for RAF Cranwell from April 1944 until its final closure in 1945, after which it was used as a camp for prisoners of war from Germany and Ukraine; the inmates were often made to work on the surrounding farmland. 
The village war memorial, a rough hewn stone Celtic Cross mounted on a plinth with a three-stepped base, is in the churchyard of St Peter's. 
On it are inscribed the names of the 22�casualties from the First World War and the 8 from the Second World War. 
Following an initial decline in the population of Navenby at the turn of the 20th century, the post-war years saw numbers rise steeply. 
This increase can be directly linked to the 35-plus new houses built from the end of the Great War until the 1950s, as well as to other building projects from the 1970s onwards. 
The parish of Navenby was originally in the higher division of the ancient Boothby Graffoe wapentake, in the North Kesteven division of the county of Lincolnshire. 
The History of the County of Lincoln, a book written by Thomas Allen in 1834, states: Navenby was classed as an ancient parish from the 11th to the 19th century, as it came "under the jurisdiction of a clergyman" and existed before 1597. 
The money generated by land rent was used by Roger de Newton, the first incumbent of the chantry chapel at Harby, Nottinghamshire, to maintain the building. 
The parish began to take on civil as well as ecclesiastical duties following the 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries and the Tudor Poor Law Acts of 1601. 
The ecclesiastical parish of Navenby was originally placed in the Longoboby Rural Deanery, but was transferred to the Graffoe Rural Deanery in 1968, and it is still part of the Diocese of Lincoln. 
The village then came under the control of North Kesteven Rural District Council from 1931–1974, after the Local Government Act 1972 reformed the districts of Holland, Kesteven and much of Lindsey into the shire county of Lincolnshire. 
Before the 1832 Reform Act, Lincolnshire sent twelve members to parliament, including two for the county, two for the city of Lincoln and two for the boroughs of Boston, Grantham, Great Grimsby and Stamford. 
The village remained in the South Division until 1867, when it was transferred to the Mid Division.

During the Ice Age, most of the region surrounding Navenby was covered by ice sheets and this has influenced the topography and nature of the soils.

The school was built by subscription in 1816 and carries the inscription "The Benefit Society 1821". 
The mean annual daily duration of bright sunshine is four hours and 12�minutes; the absence of any high ground is probably responsible for the area being one of the sunniest parts of the British Isles. 
Most of the houses (over 500) are classified as detached, the average number of rooms per property is 6.03 and the average household size is 2.31. 
The newest addition to the local airwaves is Siren FM, a community radio station that broadcasts on 107.3�FM from the University of Lincoln. 
The range, the heart of the house, was in daily use for cooking and heating until the mid-1990s. 
The only access to the bedrooms is by a ladder. 
Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap – installed to prevent the local council condemning the cottage in the late 1970s – and an inside toilet. 
The old pig sty and storage shed, deemed beyond repair, were demolished and the bricks used to construct a purpose-built visitor centre, used for exhibitions about Navenby and the local area. 
The carving is recognised as one of the finest in Lincolnshire, if not in the country, and receives a mention in virtually every book written on churches and their architecture.

The larger University of Lincoln began as the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside in 1996, when the University of Humberside opened a Lincoln campus next to Brayford Pool. 
18th-century King's Head is probably the oldest public house in the village; the nearby Lion and Royal dates from 1824 and is also Grade II listed. 
There is a large emblem over the front door, topped by the Prince of Wales's feathers, presented after the Prince (later Edward VII) stayed there, albeit briefly, in 1870. 
The former Green Man Inn, at the junction of Green Man Lane and the A15, was once a staging post for travellers and may have also been a court house. 
Navenby baker Pete Welbourne was named as Great Britain's Baker of the Year in 2004, for his Lincolnshire Plum Bread recipe, and Odling Bros butchers' shop has enjoyed repeated success in an annual competition to find the best Lincolnshire pork sausages in the county. 
The pentagram includes the nearby villages of Temple Bruer – which has strong connections with the Knights Templar of the 12th century 
Although the A607 trunk road passes through Navenby, the village can also be accessed from the "haunted" A15, which runs past the end of Green Man Lane. 
According to local legend, a hanging tree once stood at the junction of the two roads, and those who died there still haunt the area. 
Navenby's water is supplied by the Anglian Water company, and there is a sewage treatment works just west of the village. 
The East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust operates ambulances in the Navenby area, and the village is also covered by The Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Air Ambulance, based at nearby Royal Air Force Waddington on the edge of Waddington village.
