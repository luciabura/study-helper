In Christe's description, Black Sabbath's Though Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the U.S. until 1980, for many it was the definitive post Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a nonbluesy, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts.
The success of these bands and others such as Trivium, which has released both metalcore and straight ahead thrash albums, and Mastodon, which plays in a progressive sludge style, has inspired claims of a metal revival in the United States, dubbed by some critics the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.
As they experimented with the music, the UK blues based bands and the U.S. acts they influenced in turn developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal, in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound.
