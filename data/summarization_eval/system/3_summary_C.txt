NOAA predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 12–16�named storms, of which 6–8 were expected to become hurricanes, and 1–3 expected to become major hurricanes. 
On May�15, the hurricane season began in the Eastern Pacific basin, which is the area of the northern Pacific Ocean east of 140ºW. Twelve days later, an area of disturbed weather developed into the first tropical depression of the season, about 190�mi (310�km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. 
In the Eastern Pacific, Tropical Depression Two-E formed on June�3 about 145�mi (245�km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Mexico. 
The first storm of the month was Hurricane Bud, which developed early on July�11 about 805�mi (1300�km) south of Cabo San Lucas. 
Bud continued strengthening, reaching major hurricane status, or Category�3 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and peak winds of 125�mph (205�km/h) on July�13. 
One day after Bud formed, a tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression about 290�mi (465�km) off the coast of Mexico, which would later become Hurricane Carlotta. 
A large cyclone, its outer rainbands brushed the coastline of Mexico, as it steadily intensified to reach tropical storm and later hurricane status within 30�hours of forming. 
Outflow from Hurricane Bud prevented Carlotta from strengthening much further, though for a period of about 60�hours it fluctuated between strong tropical storm status and minimal hurricane status. 
As the previous two storms were dissipating, a new tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico on July�16, which would later become Hurricane Daniel. 
On July�22, it attained peak winds of 150�mph (240�km/h), a Category�4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and making Daniel the strongest hurricane during the season in the NHC area of responsibility. 
Daniel was briefly forecast to move through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm; however, the storm continued to weaken, degenerating into a remnant low on July�27 about 800�mi (1290�km) 
Weakening to a tropical storm on August�20, it later turned sharply to the west, degenerating into a remnant low on August�23 and dissipating the next day without affecting land. 
The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Ioke, which formed on August�20 far to the south of Hawaii. 
Late on August�22 it rapidly weakened to Category�2 status before crossing over Johnston Atoll, where 12�people rode out the storm in a hurricane-proof bunker. 
The next tropical depression, which would eventually become Hurricane John, formed on August�28 about 250�mi (400�km) off the coast of Mexico. 
Hurricane John continued rapid intensification and reached peak winds of 135�mph (215�km/h) on August�30 while just off the Mexican coast. 
The last storm to develop in August was Hurricane Kristy, which formed on August�30 about 935�mi (1505�km) west-northwest of Hurricane John. 
Kristy later turned to the west, oscillating between tropical depression and tropical storm status until dissipating on September�9. 
On September�18, an area of disturbed weather in the central Pacific became sufficiently organized and was designated Tropical Depression Two-C. Vertical wind shear caused the depression to weaken into a remnant low on September�20, it never having attained tropical storm status. 
Tropical Storm Olivia formed on October�9 about 700�mi (1120�km) west of Norman. 
However, a decrease in shear allowed Paul to strengthen rapidly, and in a 24-hour period it developed from a moderate tropical storm to a 105�mph (170�km/h) hurricane, its peak intensity. 
By November�2, QuikSCAT satellite suggested the system attained winds of up to 60�mph (95�km/h) about 900�mi (1450�km) west of Oregon. 
Three tropical cyclones formed, of which two became tropical storms; only one other season on record, 1966, produced two tropical storms in the month of November. 
The first storm of the month was Tropical Storm Rosa, which formed on November�8 as a tropical depression off the southwest coast of Mexico. 
On November�11, another tropical depression formed off the coast of Mexico, about 450�mi (720�km) west-southwest of where Rosa dissipated the previous day. 
During the season, tropical cyclones collectively caused 14�fatalities and $355�million in damage (2006�USD).[nb 1] With its long coastline, the country of Mexico was affected by ten of the cyclones during the season, including four that made landfall. 
Of the six storms that affected Mexico but did not strike the country, the first was Tropical Storm Aletta, the first storm of the season, which brought light rainfall and caused minor damage. 
Hurricane John was the wettest tropical cyclone of the year in Mexico, dropping 17.7�in (449�mm) of rainfall. 
Five people were killed, and damage in Mexico amounted to $663�million (2006�MXN, $60.8�million 2006�USD). 
Hurricane Lane affected 4,320�houses, and a total of 19,200�mi (30,000�km) of roads and highways were damaged to some degree. 
Monetary damage amounted to about $2.2�billion (2006�MXN, $203�million 2006�USD) in damage in the country. 
The storm damaged 5,000�houses, and monetary damage totaled more than $35�million (2006�MXN, $3.2�million 2006�USD). 
The remnants of Hurricane John produced moisture across much of the southwestern United States, causing mudslides in California, light rainfall in Arizona, overflowed rivers in New Mexico, and up to 8�in (200�mm) of rainfall in Texas. 
The remnants of Tropical Storm Fabio contributed to heavy rainfall, peaking at 15.08�in (383�mm) on Mount Waiʻaleʻale on the island of Kauai; the rainfall caused river and roadway flooding, but little damage.
