Vegetation and game in the region was similar to what is there today by the time people started to settle Yosemite Valley 3000 years ago.
In the autumn of 1833, a group led by Joseph Reddeford Walker may have seen Yosemite Valley but did not enter it.
A member of the party, Zenas Leonard, wrote in his journal that streams from the valley rim dropped "... from one lofty precipice to another, until they are exhausted in rain below.
He and his party also likely happened upon either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of Giant Sequoia, becoming the first known non-indigenous people to see the giant trees.
The part of the Sierra Nevada where the park is located was long considered to be a physical barrier to non-indigenous settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers.
On Thursday March 27 of that year the company of 50 to 60 men reached what is now called Old Inspiration Point and saw the major features of the Valley laid out before them (they named the overlook Mt. Beatitude).
In Summer or early Fall of 1853, the Ahwahneechee apparently returned to the Valley, but later betrayed the hospitality of their former Mono hosts by stealing some horses that the Mono had taken from non-indigenous ranchers.
In 1879, the more substantial Wawona Hotel was built to serve tourists visiting the nearby Grove and those on their way to the Valley (at the time, it took 8 hours to travel from Wawona to the Valley via stage).
A Unitarian minister named Thomas Starr King visited the Valley in 1860 and saw some of the negative effects that homesteading and commercial activity were having on the area.
Under Clark's on and off stewardship through 1896, access to the park by tourists improved, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable to humans.
Muir was one of the first to theorize that the major landforms in Yosemite were created by large alpine glaciers, bucking established scientists such as Josiah Whitney who regarded Muir as an amateur (see geology of the Yosemite area).
His wish was partially answered on October 1, 1890 when the area outside the valley and sequoia grove became a national park under the un-opposed Yosemite Act.
In 1905, however, a huge compromise had to be made to get Congressional and State of California approval; the park extent was reduced by more than 500�miles (800�km), excluding much of what is now the Ansel Adams Wilderness.
Water rights to Tuolumne River water were first sought by San Francisco in 1901 but were rejected in 1903 by Secretary of the Interior Ethan Allen Hitchcock who felt the application was "not in keeping with the public interest.
Pinchot, who was director of the U.S. Forest Service, wrote to his close friend Roosevelt that he believed "the highest possible use which could be made of it would be to supply pure water to a great center of population."
The broader tensions in American society were felt in Yosemite in 1970, when a large number of youths gathered in the park over the summer.
The late 1990s saw the high-profile murder case of Cary Stayner and some serious rock slides; one rockslide originating from the east side of Glacier Point ended near the Happy Isles of the Merced River, creating a debris field larger than several football fields.
