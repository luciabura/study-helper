Returning in 2006 with the Pioneers, Selwood entered his final year of junior football as one of the top rated prospects in his age group.
Nonetheless, as the equal highest-ever draft pick for the Cats, Selwood made his debut in the opening round of the 2007 AFL premiership season and missed only four games during the regular season.
From the beginning, Selwood showed an ability to influence games; in just his fourth appearance he led his older and more experienced teammates with a game of 25�disposals and nine tackles.
He was also the first to win the AFL Rising Star Award and play in a premiership side within the same season, making him one of the most accomplished first�year players in league history.
Selwood added to his list of first�year honours at season's end with the Geelong Football Club Best First Year Player Award, along with a top 20 placing in the Club Champion award.
Selwood continued to establish himself as a key player in the Geelong midfield during the 2008 AFL season, helping the Cats achieve a record-equalling 21-win season and secure the McClelland Trophy for the second successive year.
He was also selected for the preliminary 2008 All-Australian squad, placed sixth for the Leigh Matthews Trophy as the AFLPA Most Valuable Player, and finished third in voting for the Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award.
Selwood's performance in the final, during which he gathered 29�disposals—including a team-high nine contested possessions—six marks, six tackles, and six inside 50s, were recognised as he placed fourth in Norm Smith Medal voting for best afield in the Grand Final.
After averaging 28�disposals and 5�tackles per game over the course of the season, Selwood was also awarded with All-Australian honours for the first time in his career and a second successive top five placing for the Carji Greeves Medal.
Leigh Matthews has complimented Selwood as "already the best wet-weather player in the game", a view shared by Nathan Buckley, who notes that Selwood "plays with a physicality and intensity that is the benchmark of the competition, consistently (finding) third and fourth efforts to win the contested ball".
Two-time Most Courageous Player Award winner Jonathan Brown has also praised Selwood for his physical and courageous approach to winning the football, describing him as "one of the blokes (all players) within the AFL love watching".
