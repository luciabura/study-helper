GameSpot gave it a 9 out of 10 and selected it as an Editor's Choice, citing that its visual design instantly stands out, but it turns out to be just one of many inspired aspects of this impressive action adventure game.
Only one puzzle in the game had to be changed as it required knowledge of the steps in drawing a kanji character which would be readily known for Japanese audiences; for the Western release, these steps were demonstrated in the game.
In their review, Nintendo Power recommended the PlayStation 2 version of the game over the Wii, stating that Though you can overcome the drawing and attacking issues with practice and by sticking to whip style weapons , it's a hurdle you shouldn't have to leap.
