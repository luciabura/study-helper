Navenby (pronounced /ˈneɪvənbi/) is a village and civil parish in Lincolnshire, England. Lying 8.7�miles (14�km) south of Lincoln and 8.9�miles (14�km) north-northwest of Sleaford, Navenby has a population of 1,666 and is a dormitory village for Lincoln. It forms part of the North Kesteven local government district.
A Bronze Age cemetery has been discovered in the village, as well as the remains of an Iron Age settlement. Historians also believe Navenby was a significant staging point on the Roman Ermine Street, as the Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village. Navenby became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. The charter was later renewed by William Rufus, Edward III and Richard II. When the market fell into disuse in the early 19th century, Navenby returned to being a village. 
The civil parish of Navenby is rural, covering more than 2,100�acres (8.5�km2). It straddles Ermine Street, a Roman road built between 45 and 75�AD, which runs between London and York. The Viking Way, a 147-mile (237�km) footpath between the Humber Bridge in North Lincolnshire and Oakham in Rutland, also cuts through the village. The Vikings exerted great influence over Lincolnshire in the 9th and 10th centuries, as can be seen in the many local place names ending in -by, such as Navenby. Names ending with -by meant homestead or village.
