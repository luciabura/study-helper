The state election for the 51st Parliament of South Australia was held in the Australian state of South Australia on 18 March 2006, and was conducted by the independent State Electoral Office. The centre-left Australian Labor Party, in government since 2002 under Premier Mike Rann, gained six Liberal-held seats and a 7.7 percent statewide two-party preferred swing, resulting in the first Labor majority government since the 1985 election with 28 of the 47 House of Assembly (lower house) seats, a net gain of five seats. The centre-right Liberal Party of Australia, led by Leader of the Opposition Rob Kerin, regained a former independent seat while losing seats â€” the net result of 15 seats was the lowest Liberal result in any South Australian election. Independent members Bob Such and Rory McEwen retained their seats, with Kris Hanna successfully changing from Labor to an independent member. The sitting Nationals SA member Karlene Maywald retained her seat.
Independents: Rory McEwen, Bob Such, Kris Hanna
In the 22-member Legislative Council (upper house), both major parties finished with a total of eight seats each, with Labor winning four and the Liberals winning three. No Pokies independent Nick Xenophon polled 20.5 percent, an unprecedented result for an independent or minor party which resulted in both Xenophon and his running mate, Ann Bressington being elected. Xenophon's third running mate, John Darley, was appointed to the vacancy created by Xenophon's later resignation. Family First had a second member elected, the Democrats vote collapsed leaving one remaining member, and the SA Greens won a seat for the first time.
Following the outcome of the election, the member for Davenport, Iain Evans, replaced Kerin as leader of the Liberal Party and thus Leader of the Opposition.
