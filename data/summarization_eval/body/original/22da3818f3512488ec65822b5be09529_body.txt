[edit] Early history
Humans may have visited Yosemite as long ago as 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. Vegetation and game in the region was similar to what is there today by the time people started to settle Yosemite Valley 3000 years ago. Western slopes of the Sierra Nevada had acorns, deer and salmon while the eastern Sierra had pinyon nuts and obsidian. Native American groups traveled between these two areas to trade and raid.
Archaeologists divide the pre-Euro-American contact period of the region into three cultural phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000�BCE to the year 500. Hunting with the atl atl and use of grinding stones occurred during this period. The Tarmarack phase lasted from the year 500 to 1200 and is marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, which indicates development and use of the bow and arrow. Acorns also become a part of the diet at this time. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with Euro-Americans. Trade between tribes became more widespread during this period and the diet continued to improve. Miwok, Monos and Shoshonean-speaking tribes visited the area to trade. A major trading route went over Mono Pass and through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake in Eastern Californian. 
In the 11th or 12th century a band of indigenous people who called the valley that provided them with nuts, berries, and small game Ahwahnee (meaning "place of a gaping mouth") moved into the valley. They called themselves the Ah-wah-ne-chee (meaning dwellers in Ahwahnee). 
Like humans before and since, the Ahwahnechee changed the Valley to suit their needs. Since the band depended upon acorns for 60% of their diet, they burned vegetation on the Valley floor, which favored California Black Oak - an acorn-producing tree. Fire management also expanded meadows and reduced brush within woodlands, thus making ambush by invading tribes difficult.
Displaced Native Americans from the coast of California moved to the Sierra Nevada in the early to mid-19th century. They brought their experiences with Spanish food, technology, and clothing as they joined tribes in the mountains. Together they raided ranchos on the coast and drove herds of horses to the Sierra, where horse meat became a major new food source. The Shoshonean-speaking Monache moved from eastern deserts into the southern Sierra in the last three to five hundred years. 
[edit] Exploration by Europeans
Significant debate still surrounds the issue of who the first non-indigenous person to see the Valley was. Spanish missions and colonies existed along the coast of California but no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada. A group led by American fur trapper Jedediah Smith became the first Euro-Americans to cross the Sierra Nevada. They crossed at Ebbetts Pass, north of the Yosemite area in May 1827. 
In the autumn of 1833, a group led by Joseph Reddeford Walker may have seen Yosemite Valley but did not enter it. Walker approached a valley rim as he led his party of trappers across the Sierra Nevada. A member of the party, Zenas Leonard, wrote in his journal that streams from the valley rim dropped "... from one lofty precipice to another, until they are exhausted in rain below. Some of these precipices appeared to us to be more than a mile high." In 1839 a print shop fire in Philadelphia destroyed journals related to the Walker group. He and his party also likely happened upon either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of Giant Sequoia, becoming the first known non-indigenous people to see the giant trees. 
The part of the Sierra Nevada where the park is located was long considered to be a physical barrier to non-indigenous settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers. That status changed, in 1848, due to the discovery of gold in the foothills west of the range in the California Gold Rush. Travel and trade activity dramatically increased in the area, competing with the local Native Americans and destroying resources they depended upon. Disease from the newcommers spread rapidly through Native American populations and extermination of native culture became a policy of the United States Government, which obtained California from Mexico in 1848. 
The first reliable sighting of the Valley by a non-indigenous person occurred on October 18, 1849 by William P. Abrams and a companion. Abrams accurately described some landmarks but it is not known for sure whether or not he or his companion actually entered the Valley. In 1850, Joseph Screech became the first confirmed non-indigenous person to enter Hetch Hetchy Valley. He settled there, and noted that the Paiutes inhabited Hetch Hetchy before the coming of the Europeans.
The first intentional and systematic exploration of any part of the Yosemite area backcountry was conducted in 1855 by the surveying crew of Allexey W. Von Schmidt, as part of the Public Land Survey System. Von Schmidt's charge was to establish the Mount Diablo Base Line from the initial point at Mount Diablo east across the Sierra Nevada, preliminary to the General Land Office (GLO) rectangular survey in California and Nevada. This line passes through Tuolumne Meadows and very near the summit of Mount Dana, (although Von Schmidt, for unknown reasons, surveyed his line 5 to 6�miles (9.7�km) south of the actual line, which was not surveyed until around 1880). This survey was the first crossing of the Sierra Nevada that did not follow established trails or the natural routes suggested by topography. In 1863–67, the California Geological Survey surveyed parts of Yosemite's high country and the boundary of the new state park. From 1879 to 1883 large areas of the park were contracted for survey by GLO contract surveyors. However, the individual contracted for the largest area, one S.A. Hanson, was associated with the Benson Syndicate, and he combined actual with probably fabricated surveys. In 1878–79 topographic surveys performed by Lieutenant Montgomery Macomb, under George M Wheeler's Surveys West of the 100th Meridian, made use of various peaks in the high country to connect with Wheeler's extensive surveys further east, north and south.
[edit] Mariposa Wars and legacy
A mining camp was established in 1849 at Big Oak Flat on tributaries of the Tuolumne River. James Savage was running a mining operation and trading camp on the Merced River 10�miles (16�km) west of Yosemite Valley by 1850. He ran a similar camp near Mariposa. Both camps were raided by Native Americans in December 1850. The raiders retreated back in the mountains.
In 1851 the Mariposa Battalion was created under the authority of the Governor of California to put an end to these raids and starting the Mariposa Wars. James Savage led the Battalion into Yosemite Valley in 1851 while in pursuit of around 200 Ahwaneechees led by Chief Tenaya. On Thursday March 27 of that year the company of 50 to 60 men reached what is now called Old Inspiration Point and saw the major features of the Valley laid out before them (they named the overlook Mt. Beatitude). Attached to Savage's unit was Dr. Lafayette Bunnell, the company physician who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in The Discovery of the Yosemite. 
While camped at Bridalveil Meadow Bunnell suggested that the Valley be named '"Yo-sem-ity", after what the surrounding Sierra Miwok tribes, who feared the Yosemite Valley tribe, called them. At the time, Savage, who spoke some native dialects, translated this as "full-grown grizzly bear". Later translations found that the actual term, while possibly derived or at least confused with the similar uzumati or uhumati (meaning 'grizzly bear'), was in fact a Southern Sierra Miwok word Yohhe'meti meaning "they are killers". The name stuck even though the tribe they named the valley after called themselves Ahwahnechee.
Bunnell went on to name many other local topographic features on the same trip. Others in the company were also moved by what they saw and recounted their journey to friends and family after they returned, increasing interest in the Valley and surrounding area. Bunnell soon after drafted an article about the trip, but destroyed it when a newspaper correspondent in San Francisco suggested cutting his 1500�foot (460�m) height estimate for the Valley walls in half (the walls are in fact twice the height that Bunnell surmised). So the first published account of the Valley was written by Lt. Tredwell Moore for the January 20, 1854 issue of the Mariposa Chronicle. The modern spelling of Yosemite was established by that article.
Chief Tenaya and his band were eventually captured and their village burned, fulfilling a prophecy an old and dying medicine man gave Tenaya many years before. The Ahwahnechee were escorted by their captor Captain John Bowling to the Fresno River Reservation. Life on the reservation was unpleasant and the Ahwahneechee longed for their valley, prompting reservation officials to allow Tenaya and some of his band to return on their own recognizance in winter.
A group of eight miners entered the Valley in the Spring of 1852 and were allegedly attacked by Tenaya's warriors, with two of the miners being killed. A second battalion was organized, and executed six Ahwahneechee under the direction of Lt. Moore. Tenaya's band fled the Valley and sought refuge with the Mono, his mother's tribe. In Summer or early Fall of 1853, the Ahwahneechee apparently returned to the Valley, but later betrayed the hospitality of their former Mono hosts by stealing some horses that the Mono had taken from non-indigenous ranchers. In return the Monos tracked down and killed many of the remaining Ahwahneechee, including Tenaya. Tenaya Lake is named after the fallen chief. Hostilities then subsided, and by the mid 1850s local non-indigenous residents started to befriend Native Americans living in the Yosemite area.
Mono Paiutes were the only group that kept returning to the Valley on a regular basis. They lived in established native villages in the Valley into the early 20th century. As older tribe members died, younger ones tended to favor non-traditional housing provided by the National Park Service. A few Paiute and Miwok families still live in the Valley and are employed by the Park Service. A reconstructed "Indian Village of Ahwahnee" is now located behind the Yosemite Museum, which is next to the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center. The museum has exhibits that interpret the cultural history of Yosemite's indigenous residents from 1850 to the present. In addition, the museum has regularly scheduled demonstrations of basket-weaving, beadwork, and traditional games by Native American presenters.
[edit] Popularization, exploitation, and protection
[edit] Artists, photographers, and the first tourists
Forty-eight people ventured into Yosemite Valley in 1855. Among these were San Francisco writer James Mason Hutchings and artist Thomas Ayres. After returning to Mariposa Hutchings wrote an article about his experience which appeared in the July 12, 1855 issue of the Mariposa Gazette and was later published in various forms nationally. , Ayres' sketch of Yosemite Falls was published in fall that year, and four of his drawings were presented in the lead article of the July 1856 and initial issue of Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine. These were the first known accurate pictures of Yosemite Valley. Ayres returned in 1856 and visited Tuolumne Meadows in the area's high country. His highly-detailed but angularly-exaggerated artwork and his written accounts were published nationally. An art exhibition of his drawings was later held in New York City.
Hutchings brought photographer Charles Leander Weed to the Valley in 1859. Weed took the first photographs of the Valley's features, and a September exhibition in San Francisco presented them to the public. Hutchings published four installments of "The Great Yo-semite Valley" from October 1859 to March 1860 in his magazine. A book by Hutchings titled Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California collected these articles and the book stayed in print well into the 1870s. 
Stanford University mechanical engineering student Arthur Clarence Pillsbury arrived in Yosemite for the first time by bicycle in 1895. The young man fell in love with Yosemite and in 1897 bought a studio there. He visited Yosemite many times and photographed Muir, Galen Clark, George Fiske, and Teddy Roosevelt. These photos were published as postcards by the Pillsbury Picture Company. Pillsbury had begun producing postcards with his photos as soon as this innovative form of communication was authorized by Congress in 1898. His many nature films, eventually shown in theaters as well as in schools, clubs and for his lecture tours awakened the public to the need for conservation in the wake of Muir's death in 1914.
Photographer Ansel Adams, who made his first trip to Yosemite in 1916, was famous for his photographs of Yosemite in the 1920s and 30s. He willed the originals of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association, and visitors can still buy direct prints from his original negatives. The studio in which prints are sold was established in 1902 by artist Harry Cassie Best. Carleton Watkins exhibited his 17x22-inch Yosemite views at the 1867 Paris International Exposition. 
In 1856, Milton and Houston Mann (2 of 42 tourists to visit the valley the year before) finished a toll road to the Valley that traveled up the South Fork of the Merced River. Before they were bought out by Mariposa County they charged the then large sum of two dollars per person. Under county control the road was free.
Wawona was an indigenous encampment in what is now the southwestern part of the park. Settler Galen Clark discovered the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoia in Wawona in 1856; a year later he completed a bridge over the South Fork Merced in Wawona for traffic inbound to the Valley. Clark also provided a way station for tourists traveling on the road that the Mann brothers built to the Valley. Simple lodgings, later called the Lower Hotel, were completed soon afterward; Upper Hotel (later renamed Hutchings House and now known as Cedar Cottage) was opened in 1858. In 1879, the more substantial Wawona Hotel was built to serve tourists visiting the nearby Grove and those on their way to the Valley (at the time, it took 8 hours to travel from Wawona to the Valley via stage). The Washburns, owners of the hotel, bought Clark's land and covered the bridge he built. A year before the hotel was completed, A. Harris built the first public campground in Yosemite. As tourism increased, the number of trails and hotels also increased.
[edit] Early protection efforts and the state park
Visitation and interest in Yosemite continued through the American Civil War. A Unitarian minister named Thomas Starr King visited the Valley in 1860 and saw some of the negative effects that homesteading and commercial activity were having on the area. Six travel letters by King were published in the Boston Evening Transcript in 1860 and 1861 (Oliver Wendell Holmes and John Greenleaf Whittier read and commented on them). King went on to become the first person with a nationally-recognized voice to call for a public Yosemite park. Frederick Law Olmsted, the United States' most widely respected landscape architect, became interested by Kings' warnings and visited Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove in 1863.
Pressure by King and Olmstead, photographs by famed photographer Carleton Watkins, and geologic data from the 1863 Geological Survey of California prompted legislators to take notice. Senator John Conness of California introduced a Park bill in 1864 to the United States Senate that would cede Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to California. 
The uncontroversial bill passed both houses of the United States Congress and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on June 30, 1864, creating the Yosemite Grant as a public trust. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were ceded to California as a state park for "public use, resort and recreation." A board of Yosemite commissioners was proclaimed by the state's governor September that year, but the body did not convene until 1866 (with Frederick Law Olmsted as chairman). 
Galen Clark was appointed by the commission as the park's first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners had the authority to evict homesteaders, starting an 11 year struggle. Josiah Whitney, the first director of the California Geological Survey, lamented that Yosemite Valley may become like what Niagara Falls was at the time�— a tourist trap where proprietary interests place tolls on every bridge, path, trail, and viewpoint. Hutchings was one of a small group that wanted homesteading rights on 160�acres (65�ha) of the valley floor. The issue was not settled until 1875 when the land holdings of Hutchings and three others were invalidated. A State grant of $24,000 for improvements Hutchings made to Upper Hotel helped compensate for his loss. Two years after losing his land, Hutchings published a second Yosemite guide, Hutchings' Tourist Guide to the Yosemite Valley and the Big Tree Groves.
Under Clark's on and off stewardship through 1896, access to the park by tourists improved, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable to humans. Tourism started to significantly increase after a Sacramento to Stockton extension of the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 and the Central Pacific Railroad reached Merced in 1872. The long horseback ride needed to reach the area was still a deterrent, so three stagecoach roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access; Coulterville Road (June 1874), Big Oak Flat Road (July 1874), and the Mariposa/Wawona Road (July 1875). A road to Glacier Point was completed in 1882 by John Conway, and the Great Sierra Wagon Road was opened in 1883 (roughly following the Mono Trail to Tuolumne Meadows). 
Yosemite's oldest concession was established in 1884 when Mr. and Mrs. John Degnan established a bakery and store. Perhaps the most famous concession, the Curry Company, was started by David and Jenny Curry in 1899 (they founded Camp Curry, now known as Curry Village). The Currys lobbied reluctant park supervisors to expand concessionaire operations and development in the area. In 1900 Oliver Lippincott became the first person to drive an automobile into the Valley. Yosemite Valley Railroad, nicknamed "the short line to paradise", arrived at nearby El Portal, California in 1907. Tourists transferred from the railway to stagecoaches that traveled through Merced Canyon to reach Yosemite Valley.
Life on the Valley floor was plagued by mosquitoes and the threat of contracting diseases they carry. So in 1878 Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional moraine in the valley that impounded a swamp behind it. Numerous hiking and horse trails were also cleared, including a walking path through Mariposa Grove.
Clark and the reigning commissioners were ousted in 1880 by the California Legislature and Hutchings became the new park guardian. That same year Bunnell's account of the Valley's discovery was finally published. Hutchings in turn was removed as guardian in 1884 and was replaced by W.E. Dennison. Clark was reappointed as guardian in 1889.
[edit] John Muir's influence and the national park
Scotland-born naturalist John Muir first came to California in March 1868 and immediately set out for the Yosemite area. Muir studied the area's plants, rocks and animals in the summer of 1869 while employed by rancher Pat Delaney to accompany his sheep and sheepherder. Soon after, Hutchings hired Muir to operate a sawmill. Articles written by Muir helped to both popularize the area and increase scientific interest in it. Muir was one of the first to theorize that the major landforms in Yosemite were created by large alpine glaciers, bucking established scientists such as Josiah Whitney who regarded Muir as an amateur (see geology of the Yosemite area). Muir also wrote scientific papers on the area's biology.
Alarmed by over-grazing of meadows (especially by sheep who Muir called "hooved locusts"), logging of Giant Sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed from being a promoter and scientist to an advocate for further protection. As part of this new role he persuaded many influential people to accompany him to camp in the park, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871. On these trips Muir would try to convince his guests of the importance of putting the area under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir's cause except for Robert Underwood Johnson, who was editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty Congressional lobbyist. 
His wish was partially answered on October 1, 1890 when the area outside the valley and sequoia grove became a national park under the un-opposed Yosemite Act. The Act withdrew these lands from "settlement, occupancy, or sale" and protected "all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities or wonders" along with prohibiting "wanton destruction of the fish and game and their capture or destruction for the purposes of merchandise or profit". This was the first time the federal government set aside land for such a purpose. It is important to note, that Yosemite National Park does include the entire upper drainages of two separate river watersheds (which was very important to Muir who said "you cannot save Yosemite Valley without saving its Sierran fountains."). The State of California, however, retained control of the Valley and Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite High Country. A dairy herd was kept in the valley and all horses brought there grazed in its meadows, however. Muir and 181 others founded the Sierra Club in 1892, in part to lobby for the transfer of the Valley and Grove into the National Park. 
[edit] Army administration and a unified national park
Like Yellowstone National Park before it, Yosemite was at first administered by the United States Army. Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the new park on May 19, 1891 and set up camp in Wawona, called Camp A.E. Wood (now the Wawona Campground). Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park. A major problem facing the Cavalry were the approximately 100,000 sheep that were illegally led into Yosemite's high meadows by shepherds each year. Lacking the legal authority to arrest the herders, the Cavalry instead escorted the shepherds several days hike away from their flock. This left the sheep vulnerable and thus became an excellent deterrent. By the late 1890s sheep grazing was no longer a problem, but at least one herder continued grazing his sheep in the park into the 1920s. 
An extensive trail system developed by the Cavalry later formed the basis for the current trails. To mark trails, the cavalrymen blazed capital Ts into trees, a practice continued from that point onward even though none of the originally blazed trees are still standing.
Galen Clark retired as the state park's guardian in 1896, leaving the Valley and Grove under ineffective stewardship. Pre-existing problems in the state park worsened and new problems arose, but the Cavalry could only monitor the situation. Long a proponent of creating a unified Yosemite national park, Muir and his Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people for the creation of a unified Yosemite National Park. In an effort to make the remote area more accessible, the Sierra Club began organizing annual trips to Yosemite, starting in 1901 (a practice that continues to the present day). The LeConte Memorial Lodge is a National Historic Landmark built in 1902 as an education center in honor of Joseph LeConte, a University of California geologist who died in Yosemite Valley the year before.
Then in May 1903, Theodore Roosevelt�– who was then President of the United States�– camped with John Muir near Glacier Point for three days. On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of the Valley and the Grove away from California and give it to the federal government. In 1906 Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that, and the Superintendent's headquarters was moved from the Wawona area to Yosemite Valley.
In 1905, however, a huge compromise had to be made to get Congressional and State of California approval; the park extent was reduced by more than 500�miles (800�km), excluding much of what is now the Ansel Adams Wilderness. This compromise excluded natural wonders such as Devils Postpile and prime wildlife habitat. Another reduction in the size of the park occurred near Wawona in 1906 and logging started soon afterward in former park-lands. In 1908 acting superintendent Major H. C. Benson said that "game is on the decrease. Each reduction of the park has cut another portion of the winter resort of game." All the boundary changes resulted in a reduction of one third of the park's area. 
About 12,000�acres (4,900�ha) between Tuolumne and Merced big tree groves was added to the park in 1930 through land purchases by the federal government and matching funds provided by John D. Rockefeller. Another 8,765�acres (3,547�ha) near Wawona were added in 1932 and the Carl Inn Tract, located near the Rockefeller purchase, was secured in 1937 and 1939. 
Army administration of the Park ended in 1914 as well as horse-drawn stage service. Two years of minimal civilian stewardship ensued with 15 former cavalry scouts serving as the only rangers. This task was made all the more difficult due to increasing visitation by motorists. Park visitation doubled in 1915 to 31,000 (the 1915 entrance fee for motorists was $5, more than an average worker made in a day). In an attempt to keep up with demand, stage service was briefly renewed but ended for good in 1916.
The National Park Service was formed in 1916 and Yosemite was transferred to that agency's jurisdiction with W.B. Lewis as superintendent. Tuolumne Meadows Lodge and Tioga Pass Road, along with campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes, were also completed in 1916. 600 automobiles entered the east side of the Park using Tioga Road that summer. Stephen Mather, the first director of the Park Service, built the "Ranger's Club" at his own expense in 1920 to house Yosemite rangers. Mather donated it to the park and it is now maintained as a National Historic Landmark. In 1926 the "All-Weather Highway" (now State Route 140) opened, ensuring year-long visitation and supplies under normal conditions. The completion of the 0.8�mile (1.3�km) long Wawona Tunnel in 1933 was both an engineering marvel and significantly reduced the amount of travel time to the Valley from Wawona without scarring the landscape with a long road cut (the famous 'Tunnel View' is on the Valley side of the tunnel and Inspiration Point is above it). A flood, reduced lumber and mining extraction, and greatly increased automobile and bus use forced the Yosemite Valley Railway out of business in 1945. The present day Tioga Road (part of State Route 120) across the park was dedicated in 1961.
Starting in 1920, the groundwork for interpretive programs and services in national parks was laid in Yosemite by Harold C. Bryant and Loye Holmes, two professors of natural history. The position of park naturalist was created in 1921 with Ansel F. Hall performing that duty for two years. Hall pioneered the idea of having park museums act as public contact centers and general headquarters for interpretive programs�— a model followed by all later national parks in the United States and widely adapted internationally as well. Chris Jorgenson's former artist's studio was used to house the temporary museum from 1921 to 1926. Yosemite Museum, the first permanent museum in the National Park System, was completed in 1926. 
[edit] The fight over Hetch Hetchy Valley
To the north of Yosemite Valley is Hetch Hetchy Valley, which was considered by many, including John Muir, to be comparable in beauty and significance to Yosemite Valley. The earliest Native peoples of Hetch Hetchy were Paiutes.
Water rights to Tuolumne River water were first sought by San Francisco in 1901 but were rejected in 1903 by Secretary of the Interior Ethan Allen Hitchcock who felt the application was "not in keeping with the public interest." Devastation of the the city by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake tipped the balance. Rights to Hetch Hetchy were granted to the City of San Francisco in 1908 by Secretary of the Interior James Garfield. Garfield wrote; "Domestic use is the highest use to which water and available storage basins.... can be put." 
A long and nationally-polarized fight, pitting preservationists like Muir who wanted to leave wild areas wild against conservationists like Gifford Pinchot who wanted to manage wild areas for the betterment of mankind, ensued. Muir, aided by Robert Underwood Johnson and his Sierra Club, wrote "Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for watertanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man." Pinchot, who was director of the U.S. Forest Service, wrote to his close friend Roosevelt that he believed "the highest possible use which could be made of it would be to supply pure water to a great center of population." Roosevelt reluctantly sided with Pinchot.
Roosevelt's successor, Woodrow Wilson signed the Raker Act in law on December 13, 1913, which authorized construction of the O'Shaughnessy Dam. The valley was flooded in 1923 by impounding of the Tuolumne River behind the O'Shaughnessy Dam, forming the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. The dam supplies 80% of the drinking water, and some cash from electricity sales, to San Francisco.
Shortly before Muir died he expressed the hope that "some compensating good must follow" from the Raker Act. The fight over the dam strengthened the conservation movement by popularizing it nationally.
[edit] More recent history
The Ahwahnee Hotel, built in 1927 in Yosemite Valley, is a luxury hotel decorated in Native American motifs. It was designed by the architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood who designed lodges at many of the national parks. For many years Ansel Adams produced an annual pageant there, and in World War II it was used as a rehabilitation hospital for soldiers. It is now a National Historic Landmark.
Yosemite National Park has had 11 winter floods since 1916 that have caused substantial damage to property. All of these floods took place between November 1 and January 30. The largest floods occurred in 1937, 1950, 1955, and 1997, and were in the range of 22,000 to 25,000 cubic feet (620 to 700�m³) per second, as measured at the Pohono Bridge gauging station in Yosemite Valley. After the 1950 flood, all structures in Old Yosemite Village, except for the chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished in the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures from throughout the park were also moved to the history center. Some structures in the Old Village, such as the historic 1858 Cedar Cottage, then the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, were demolished even though they weren't flooded. Back then little regard was given to historic preservation, the thought being that the "highest use" was preserving and restoring natural scenery.
Three different protected zones were added adjacent to Yosemite National Park in 1964:
These additional protected areas include areas removed from Yosemite National Park just prior to the 1906 Act as well as other public land.
A 1964 act of Congress set aside about 94% of the park in a highly protected wilderness area. No roads, motorized vehicles (except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles), or any development of any kind beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area.
In 1968 the famous Yosemite Firefall, in which the embers from a bonfire were pushed off of a cliff near Glacier Point to create a spectacular effect, was ended because it drew excessively large crowds. The Firefall was occasionally performed in the 1870s and became a nightly tradition with the founding of Camp Curry.
The broader tensions in American society were felt in Yosemite in 1970, when a large number of youths gathered in the park over the summer. Rioting broke out on July 4 in Stoneman Meadow. The visitors attacked rangers with rocks and pulled mounted rangers from their horses. The National Guard was brought in to maintain order.
The late 1990s saw the high-profile murder case of Cary Stayner and some serious rock slides; one rockslide originating from the east side of Glacier Point ended near the Happy Isles of the Merced River, creating a debris field larger than several football fields. Tourism dropped a little after those incidents, but soon after returned to previous levels.
[edit] Human impact
Early park guardians took actions, such as draining swamps, that reduced the number and extent of these meadows. In the 1860s there were over 750�acres (300�ha) of meadows in the valley compared to 340�acres (140�ha) by the end of the 20th century. These modern meadows must be maintained by removing trees and shrubs.
Muir and the Sierra Club at first encouraged efforts to increase visitation. Muir wrote that even the "... frivolous and inappreciative ..." visitors were on the whole "... a most hopeful sign of the times, indicating at least the beginning of our return to nature—for going to the mountains is going home." 
The first automobile entered the Valley in 1900, but growth in car traffic did not increase significantly until 1913 when they were first officially allowed to enter. In 1914, 127 cars entered the park. 
Visitation rapidly swelled with the advent of the automobile. Park visitation increased from 15,154 in 1914 to 35,527 in 1918 and then 461,000 in 1929. Two thirds of a million visited in 1946. Visitation reached 1 million in 1954, 2 million by 1966, 3 million in the 1980s and 4 million in the 1990s. Car use has proportionately increased too. These millions of users have dramatically influenced the local ecosystem.
Decades of aggressive fire suppression have been replaced by a fire management program that includes the yearly use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the Giant Sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.
In March 1986 the California Department of Fish and Game, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Forest Service reintroduced Bighorn Sheep just east of the park in Lee Vining Canyon. The herd reached a peak of nearly 100 individuals in 1994, but almost 60% of the herd died in the winter of 1994–1995. About 55 bighorns from the herd were counted in the 1996 census.
Brown Bears, also called grizzlies, were once the top predators in the region but went locally extinct in the 1920s. The last confirmed kill of a Yosemite grizzly occurred in Wawona in 1895. These animals figured prominently in Miwok mythology, and a sketch of a Yosemite grizzly by Charles Nahl adorns the flag of California. Inevitable losses of cattle, and danger to people, makes the prospect of reintroduction into the park remote. Other predators, such as coyote, fox, lynx, mountain lion, and wolverine were trapped for their firs by rangers to supplement their incomes. This practice continued until 1925 but predator control continued; the state lion hunter killed 43 mountain lions in Yosemite in 1927. Cooper's hawk and sharp-shinned hawk were hunted and have since became locally extinct. 
The introduction of trout in Yosemite streams and lakes had a negative impact on native frog populations due to tadpole predation. Lakes and streams are no longer stocked in the park. Tule elk, which were near extinction, were housed in a pen in Yosemite before being moved to the Owens Valley in eastern California. Feeding and viewing of American black bears was encouraged by park concessionaires who provided trash for the animals to eat. Bears were a common attraction by the 1930s; In 1929 alone 81 people were treated for bear-related injuries. Troublesome bears were marked with white paint and relocated to other parts of the park. Repeat offenders were killed.
Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940 but the Park Service continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps; 200 bears were put down between 1960 and 1972. The Park Service now emphasizes education of park visitors about proper storage of food in order to avoid having to relocate and destroy bears. Bighorn sheep, which were driven locally extinct through hunting and disease, have been reintroduced in the eastern part of the park. 
The Park Service has also prohibited driving and camping in meadows, which was a common practice in the 1910s to 1930s. Cattle and horses no longer freely roam the park. Over one half billion board feet of timber were felled between World War I and 1930, when John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and the federal government bought out the Yosemite Lumber Company. Yet there were still 1300 buildings in the valley and 17�acres (6.9�ha) of the valley floor were covered by parking lots in the late 1990s. 
Plans for reducing the human impact on the park were released by the Park Service in 1980. The General Management Plan specified a reduction of 17% in overnight accommodations, a 68% reduction in staff housing and removal of golf courses and tennis courts by 1990. This goal was not met but flooding in January 1997 destroyed park infrastructure in Yosemite Valley. The Yosemite Valley Plan was later established to implement the General Management Plan and over 250 other actions."Yosemite Valley Plan: The Story and the Process".

Many visitors fail to realize the wild aspect of the park, and tend to treat it like a zoo�— feeding animals, petting them, taking mementos home; this is a dramatic safety issue for the visitors and is also illegal. Squirrels that feed all summer become obese, making them prey for Mountain Lions, which are a safety issue unto themselves. Food left in cars are easy pickings for the local Black Bear populations. Petting Mule Deer risks serious injury (the only person killed in Yosemite by an animal was killed by a deer). The Park Service, in conjunction with businesses and groups in the park, are trying to encourage people to experience and learn about Yosemite.
Trails and high use areas are redesigned to reduce impact. A free shuttle bus system has been developed to help relieve summer traffic congestion in the valley. Proposals to exclude cars in the summer that are not registered at a hotel or campsite within the valley have been investigated (this has already been implemented at other parks, such as Zion National Park in Utah). Many agencies in the Park offer educational activities and trips. Ironically, only about 14 square miles (36�km²) of the 1,200�mi² of the park are visited by a majority of the people.
