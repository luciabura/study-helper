[edit] Seasonal forecasts
On May�22, 2006, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released their forecasts for the 2006 Atlantic, East Pacific, and Central Pacific hurricane seasons. The Pacific season was expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in 1995, which generally increased wind shear across the basin. NOAA predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 12–16�named storms, of which 6–8 were expected to become hurricanes, and 1–3 expected to become major hurricanes. The Central Pacific basin was also expected to be below average, with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area. They expected that neither El Niño nor La Niña would affect conditions significantly. 
[edit] Storms
[edit] May and June
On May�15, the hurricane season began in the Eastern Pacific basin, which is the area of the northern Pacific Ocean east of 140ºW. Twelve days later, an area of disturbed weather developed into the first tropical depression of the season, about 190�mi (310�km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. It quickly intensified into a tropical storm, and upon doing so was named Aletta. The storm drifted northeastward toward the coast, bringing light rainfall before turning southward. Wind shear weakened the storm, and on May�31 Aletta dissipated about 200�mi (320�km) west-northwest of where it formed. 
On June�1, the season began in the Central Pacific basin, which is the region between 140ºW and the International Dateline; however, no storms occurred in the basin until July. In the Eastern Pacific, Tropical Depression Two-E formed on June�3 about 145�mi (245�km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Mexico. It tracked eastward and brought heavy rainfall to the coastline, with a report of about 11�inches (280�mm) in Acapulco. Land interaction weakened the depression, and it dissipated on June�5. No tropical storms developed in June in the basin, which was unusual compared to the average of two storms forming during the month. Since 1966, there have been only three other seasons in which a tropical storm did not form in June, these being 1969, 2004, and 2007. 
[edit] July
After about a month of no storms, the basin became active in July. The first storm of the month was Hurricane Bud, which developed early on July�11 about 805�mi (1300�km) south of Cabo San Lucas. Moving west-northwestward, it encountered conditions for quick strengthening, and within 24�hours of forming it attained hurricane status. Bud continued strengthening, reaching major hurricane status, or Category�3 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and peak winds of 125�mph (205�km/h) on July�13. Thereafter, cooler waters and stable air caused the hurricane to quickly weaken. On July�14, Bud weakened to tropical storm status, and two days later it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The remnants of Bud dissipated on July�17 about 750�mi (1210�km) east-southeast of Hawaii. 
One day after Bud formed, a tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression about 290�mi (465�km) off the coast of Mexico, which would later become Hurricane Carlotta. A large cyclone, its outer rainbands brushed the coastline of Mexico, as it steadily intensified to reach tropical storm and later hurricane status within 30�hours of forming. Outflow from Hurricane Bud prevented Carlotta from strengthening much further, though for a period of about 60�hours it fluctuated between strong tropical storm status and minimal hurricane status. Cooler waters weakened the storm, and on July�16 Carlotta degenerated into a remnant low. Its low-level circulation persisted for three days before dissipating. 
As the previous two storms were dissipating, a new tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico on July�16, which would later become Hurricane Daniel. It moved westward, gradually intensifying under favorable conditions. On July�22, it attained peak winds of 150�mph (240�km/h), a Category�4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and making Daniel the strongest hurricane during the season in the NHC area of responsibility. Maintaining Category�4 status for about three days, the hurricane subsequently weakened quickly due to cooler waters. Daniel was briefly forecast to move through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm; however, the storm continued to weaken, degenerating into a remnant low on July�27 about 800�mi (1290�km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. Its remnants brought moderate rainfall to the region, though no damage or deaths were reported. 
Another tropical depression formed off the coast of Mexico on July�21. It tracked northward toward the coast, strengthening into Tropical Storm Emilia and attaining peak winds of 65�mph (105�km/h). It briefly developed an eye, though weakened due to increased wind shear as it turned away from the coast. Emilia later turned to the north, restrengthening to its peak intensity before weakening and paralleling the coastline of the Baja California peninsula. After dropping moderate rainfall along the peninsula, it weakened further as it turned out to sea, and on July�27 degenerated into a remnant low. 
The final storm of the month formed on July�31 from a tropical wave, well to the southwest of Mexico. It maintained a steady westward track throughout its duration, and quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Fabio. On August�1 it attained peak winds of 50�mph (85�km/h), but subsequently began gradually weakening due to wind shear. Fabio degenerated into a remnant low on August�4, and a few days later brought locally heavy rainfall to Hawaii. 
[edit] August
Within the basin, more tropical cyclones developed in August than in any other month. The first storm of the month was Tropical Storm Gilma, which in terms of winds was tied with Rosa for the weakest named storm of the season. Gilma developed on August�1 off the southwest coast of Mexico, attaining peak winds of 40�mph (65�km/h). The storm was disorganized due to persistent wind shear, which prevented further strengthening. On August�5 the cyclone dissipated without ever having affected land. 
After a period of inactivity lasting a week and a half, a tropical depression formed southwest of Mexico on August�15. It tracked generally west-northwestward for its entire duration, eventually becoming Hurricane Hector. On August�18, it attained peak winds of 110�mph (175�km/h), before gradually weakening due to cooler waters. Weakening to a tropical storm on August�20, it later turned sharply to the west, degenerating into a remnant low on August�23 and dissipating the next day without affecting land. 
The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Ioke, which formed on August�20 far to the south of Hawaii. It was the first central Pacific named storm since Hurricane Huko in 2002. Encountering warm waters and little wind shear, and maintaining well-defined outflow, Ioke intensified from a tropical depression to Category�4 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale within 48�hours. Late on August�22 it rapidly weakened to Category�2 status before crossing over Johnston Atoll, where 12�people rode out the storm in a hurricane-proof bunker. Two days later, favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening, and Ioke attained Category�5 status on August�25 before crossing the International Date Line. As it continued westward its intensity fluctuated, and on August�31 it passed near Wake Island with winds of 155�mph (249�km/h). Ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward, and by September�6 transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into Alaska. 
On August�21 shortly after the previous storm formed, Hurricane Ileana developed off the southwest coast of Mexico. It generally paralleled the coastline throughout its duration, ultimately reaching peak winds of 120�mph (195�km/h) before weakening. Around the time of peak intensity, the hurricane passed near Socorro Island, where it produced hurricane-force wind gusts. On August�27, Ileana degenerated into a remnant low, and two days later dissipated well offshore. 
The next tropical depression, which would eventually become Hurricane John, formed on August�28 about 250�mi (400�km) off the coast of Mexico. With favorable environmental conditions, the system quickly organized, becoming a hurricane within 36�hours of forming. Hurricane John continued rapid intensification and reached peak winds of 135�mph (215�km/h) on August�30 while just off the Mexican coast. Land interaction weakened the hurricane, and still tracking northwestward it struck the eastern portion of the Baja California peninsula on September�2 as a Category�2 hurricane. John dissipated on September�4, though its remnants brought rainfall to the southwest United States. 
The last storm to develop in August was Hurricane Kristy, which formed on August�30 about 935�mi (1505�km) west-northwest of Hurricane John. It initially tracked northwestward, reaching peak winds of 80�mph (130�km/h) within 36�hours of forming. Outflow from Hurricane John caused Kristy to weaken, and at the same time, the storm's motion became nearly stationary as steering currents collapsed. On September�2 it turned to a southeast drift, and degenerated into a tropical depression around the same time. Kristy later turned to the west, oscillating between tropical depression and tropical storm status until dissipating on September�9. 
[edit] September
Hurricane Lane developed from a tropical wave on September�13 to the south of Mexico. It moved northwestward parallel to the coast of Mexico, and steadily intensified in a favorable environment. After turning to the northeast Lane attained peak winds of 125�mph (205�km/h), and made landfall in the Mexican state of Sinaloa at peak strength. It rapidly weakened and dissipated on September�17, and later brought precipitation to southern Texas. 
An area of disturbed weather associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone spawned a tropical depression on September�16 off the coast of Mexico. Despite being disorganized, it quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Miriam. The storm was sheared throughout its duration, and after encountering cooler waters Miriam dissipated on September�18 near the Baja California peninsula. 
On September�18, an area of disturbed weather in the central Pacific became sufficiently organized and was designated Tropical Depression Two-C. Vertical wind shear caused the depression to weaken into a remnant low on September�20, it never having attained tropical storm status. The depression was initially thought to be a regeneration of earlier Hurricane Kristy. 
On September�26, another area of disturbed weather in the Central Pacific near the International Date Line became organized and was designated Tropical Depression Three-C. However, wind shear and the presence of dry air to the west inhibited further development, and the system dissipated 12�hours later; at around the same time, the system crossed into the Western Pacific. 
[edit] October
The first cyclone to develop in the month of October was Tropical Storm Norman, which formed well off the coast of Mexico on October�9. It quickly reached peak winds of 50�mph (85�km/h), though almost as quickly the cyclone degenerated into a remnant low due to wind shear. Its remnants turned to the east, and on October�15 regenerated into a tropical cyclone just off the coast of Mexico after merging with another disturbance. Norman quickly dissipated as unfavorable conditions returned, although it brought heavy rainfall to the Mexican coastline. 
Tropical Storm Olivia formed on October�9 about 700�mi (1120�km) west of Norman. Tracking northeastward and attaining tropical storm status, it failed to strengthen significantly due to wind shear. Olivia weakened to tropical depression status on October�11, and turning to the east-southeast degenerated into a remnant low two days later. Its remnants were later absorbed by a larger disturbance that included the remnants of Norman. 
The final cyclone to develop within the CPHC area of responsibility was Tropical Depression Four-C, which formed on October�13 to the southwest of Hawaii. Within 24�hours of forming, it degenerated into a remnant disturbance due to unfavorable wind shear. Moisture from the depression contributed to heavy rainfall in Hawaii. 
The strongest hurricane during the month was Hurricane Paul. Forming on October�21, it did not strengthen much initially due to the presence of wind shear. However, a decrease in shear allowed Paul to strengthen rapidly, and in a 24-hour period it developed from a moderate tropical storm to a 105�mph (170�km/h) hurricane, its peak intensity. By that time, it had turned northeastward and entered an unfavorable environment, which caused Paul to steadily weaken to tropical storm status. After passing south of the Baja California peninsula it deteriorated to tropical depression status and moved ashore in northwestern Sinaloa. 
On October�26 shortly after Paul dissipated, another tropical depression formed off the southwest coast of Mexico. Moving southwestward, it encountered unfavorable wind shear, which prevented strengthening. On October�28 it degenerated into a remnant low, and the next day dissipated without affecting land. 
[edit] Unclassified storm
An extratropical storm persisted in the extreme northern central Pacific Ocean in late October. It drifted over unusually warm waters up to 3.6°F (2°C) above normal, and gradually developed convection near the center. By November�2, QuikSCAT satellite suggested the system attained winds of up to 60�mph (95�km/h) about 900�mi (1450�km) west of Oregon. The system also developed an eye and an eyewall. The cyclone tracked northeastward as it gradually weakened, and dissipated on November�4. NASA considered the cyclone to be a subtropical storm. However, as it formed outside of the territory of any monitoring organization, it was not named. Operationally, the United States Navy treated the system as a tropical disturbance, numbered 91C. 
[edit] November
Tropical activity within the basin in November�2006 was the most active on record, based on the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index. Three tropical cyclones formed, of which two became tropical storms; only one other season on record, 1966, produced two tropical storms in the month of November. The first storm of the month was Tropical Storm Rosa, which formed on November�8 as a tropical depression off the southwest coast of Mexico. Immediate development was hampered by wind shear, although an increase in thunderstorms on November�9 brought the depression to tropical storm status. Continued shear prevented intensification, and Rosa dissipated on November�10. Rosa was the first Eastern Pacific tropical storm in November since another storm named Rosa in the 2000 season. 
On November�11, another tropical depression formed off the coast of Mexico, about 450�mi (720�km) west-southwest of where Rosa dissipated the previous day. Similar to Rosa, it developed within an environment with unfavorable wind shear, but failed to intensify beyond tropical depression status. About 18�hours after it formed the depression degenerated into a trough. 
The final storm of the season was Hurricane Sergio, which was both the strongest and longest-lived November Pacific hurricane on record. It formed on November�13 about 460�mi (740�km) south of Manzanillo, Colima, and steadily intensified while tracking southeastward. It reached peak winds of 110�mph (175�km/h) on November�15, and subsequently began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it turned to the north. Sergio later turned to the west, remaining well off the coast of Mexico, and dissipated on November�20 about 320�mi (515�km) west-northwest of it originally formed. The storm brought light rainfall to the Mexican coastline, though no major effects were reported. 
[edit] Impact
During the season, tropical cyclones collectively caused 14�fatalities and $355�million in damage (2006�USD).[nb 1]
With its long coastline, the country of Mexico was affected by ten of the cyclones during the season, including four that made landfall. Of the six storms that affected Mexico but did not strike the country, the first was Tropical Storm Aletta, the first storm of the season, which brought light rainfall and caused minor damage. The next tropical depression of the season produced heavy rainfall in the Acapulco area while remaining offshore; mudslides and flooding were reported, and 72�people were forced to leave their homes. In July, Hurricane Carlotta brushed the coastline with light rainfall. When Tropical Storm Emilia passed just off the coast of Baja California, it brought moderate precipitation which caused minor flooding and damage around Cabo San Lucas. Heavy surf from Hurricane Ileana killed a man near Cabo San Lucas. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Sergio, produced light rainfall along the coast while remaining well offshore. 
Mexico was struck by four tropical cyclones in 2006, all along the Pacific coast. The first was Hurricane John, which made landfall near the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula on September�1. Earlier, it produced flooding and high surf near Acapulco while paralleling the coastline, and later the hurricane damaged or destroyed at least 450�homes in the Baja California peninsula. Hurricane John was the wettest tropical cyclone of the year in Mexico, dropping 17.7�in (449�mm) of rainfall. Five people were killed, and damage in Mexico amounted to $663�million (2006�MXN, $60.8�million 2006�USD). Hurricane Lane moved ashore in the state of Sinaloa as a Category�3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which was the strongest landfall during the season. Paralleling the coastline a short distance offshore, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, causing flooding and mudslides which resulted in four fatalities. Hurricane Lane affected 4,320�houses, and a total of 19,200�mi (30,000�km) of roads and highways were damaged to some degree. Monetary damage amounted to about $2.2�billion (2006�MXN, $203�million 2006�USD) in damage in the country. In early October, former Tropical Storm Norman passed near or over southwestern Mexico, destroying 20�houses and leaving 20�villages without power. Later, former Hurricane Paul caused four deaths, two of which from rough seas and two from drowning in a flooded river. The storm damaged 5,000�houses, and monetary damage totaled more than $35�million (2006�MXN, $3.2�million 2006�USD). 
Three of the cyclones that affected Mexico also impacted the southwestern United States. Moisture from Tropical Storm Emilia produced thunderstorms in Arizona which caused flooding, and in southern California its rainfall assisted firefighters in combating a wildfire. The remnants of Hurricane John produced moisture across much of the southwestern United States, causing mudslides in California, light rainfall in Arizona, overflowed rivers in New Mexico, and up to 8�in (200�mm) of rainfall in Texas. In western Texas, the precipitation was beneficial in some areas but damaging in others, causing flooded roads and washouts. The remnants of Hurricane Lane also produced rainfall in Texas. 
Four tropical cyclones affected the U.S. state of Hawaii, all of which were the remnants of former tropical cyclones. Moisture from Hurricane Bud produced light rainfall in east-facing slopes of the island chain. Former Hurricane Daniel produced up to 5�in (125�mm) of rainfall in the state, though no significant impact was reported. The remnants of Tropical Storm Fabio contributed to heavy rainfall, peaking at 15.08�in (383�mm) on Mount Waiʻaleʻale on the island of Kauai; the rainfall caused river and roadway flooding, but little damage. Moisture from Tropical Depression Four-C in October contributed to heavy rainfall on the island of Hawaii. 
The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Ioke, which reached Category 5 status in the central Pacific Ocean. It first affected the uninhabited Johnston Atoll, although when Ioke struck there was a crew of 12�people taking shelter on the island. Hurricane force winds affected the landmass, powerful enough to knock down trees. In the western Pacific Ocean after being re-classified as a typhoon, Ioke passed near Wake Island, forcing the first full-scale evacuation of the island since a typhoon in 1967. The combination of strong winds and a powerful storm surge damaged 70% of the buildings on the island, many with moderate roof damage. Destruction on the island was estimated at $88�million (2006�USD). Later, the storm passed near the Japanese island of Minami Torishima, which was also fully evacuated; facilities on the island were damaged, although it was repaired and fully operational within three weeks after the storm. The remnants of Ioke later brought hurricane force wind gusts to southwestern Alaska. 
[edit] Season effects
This is a table of the storms in 2006 and their landfall(s), if any; the table does not include storms that did not make landfall, which is defined as the center of the storm moving over a landmass. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but are still storm-related. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low.
[edit] Storm names
The following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 2006. This is the same list that was used in the 2000 season. There were no names retired from the northeast Pacific list. Therefore, the same list will be reused in the 2012 season.
Storms that formed in the central Pacific are given names from a sequential list; in 2006, the name Ioke was used from this list, the first time a name from the Central Pacific list had been used since the 2002 season.
[edit] Retirement
The name Ioke was retired from the north-central Pacific list by the WMO in the spring of 2007 and replaced with Iopa. During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name Daniel, citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat or damage. However, the request was denied, as the name remains on the tropical cyclone naming list.
